                "body": "@martin-josef as far as your report is a really complete one, it's hard to track it down as a bug.\r\n\r\nIt's not reproducible, as you reported. What we probably have is a behavior in Wordmove that your current hosting provider dislikes.\r\n\r\nI can't elaborate a solution but I have a previous experience to share; Wordmove has a somewhat defective behavior when working w/ DB: it makes a lot of subsequent connections. Sometimes hosting providers set a throttle limit in order to protect themselves from ddos-like attempts and this limit could happen to resolve into a refute to auth the user.\r\n\r\nOne desperate try to do in order to verify this assumption is to add these configs to the specific host into your ssh config\r\n\r\n```\r\nHost example.com\r\n  ControlMaster auto\r\n  ControlPath /tmp/master-%r@%h:%p\r\n  [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen in one terminal open an SSH connection to the host and in another terminal run `wordmove pull -e production -d`. This way you should force SSH client to reuse a single connection through a local socket (don't know if it's actually a socket, but at least it has a similar concept).\r\n\r\nIs this a fix? It is not for sure. It's more of a troubleshooting/possible workaround/reproduction path, but that's all I have on the table.",

They were introduced recently in https://github.com/adomokos/light-service/pull/194. Thus I cannot afford to remove ActiveSupport with a one-shot PR. Nor I want to take decisions about how to continue from now on w/o including maintainer and community into the discussion.\r\n\r\n**Is it worth to add more dependencies w/o removing ActiveSupport?**\r\n\r\nIdeally not, but from a transitional perspective, yes. Now we have a single well scoped feature requiring ActiveSupport instead of having code bites spread all over the code base.\r\nI'm bringing the gem in a more free and easier to manage position in regard of AS dep.\r\n\r\n**What about the two new dependencies?**\r\n\r\nI added https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-inflector/ and https://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings\r\n\r\nBoth were choosen because they are small, dependency-free gems with single functionality.\r\n\r\n`dry-inflector` is from the (beloved by me) dry-rb ecosystem (https://dry-rb.org/). Neat, iper-atomic and well written. It is the Hanami inflector.\r\n\r\n`structured_warnings` is a neat, very small gem; it has not been updated recently, but IMO it doesn't need to be. It works on  ruby 3.1 and its approach is simple and far (FAR) less polluting than ActiveSupport's one. I was able to implement a custom matcher for `rspec` too, writing expressive tests. Moreover its interface made possible to do a surgical substitution in the actual code base.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, being the maintainer of the project, I'd think about splitting rails generators into a separate gem. This would enclose ActiveSupport and Rails-only things in cleaner context, easier to maintain. And the test suite of the \"core\" gem would lose all the complexity inherent to testing against all the possible AS versions.\r\n\r\nI thought to open this one as a draft, but I decided to concretely propose something :) No problem turning it into draft or to use this just as a discussion desk and then close it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.

                "body": "I like to re-underline that `i18n` here is not added, but just made explicit: it's already an [AS's dependency](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activesupport/activesupport.gemspec). As it stands it's just a peer dependence through AS but it is explicitly used for failure message translation. Having it as a direct dependence was a way to underline the fact that even in the will to remove AS we'll have to retain `i18n`.\r\n\r\nIMO we should be able to avoid `i18n` dependency too, making it opt-in: if an implementor would like to use translated messages she should add `i18n` to her bundle and LS would pick it up automatically. If absent and a `Symbol` is passed as failure message, LS could drop a warning ad just `.to_s` the symbol.\r\n\r\nI know this i18n-related discourse may seem OT, but I consider part of the \"dependent-free\" path you are picturing.\r\n\r\nComing on the spot of your comment now :)\r\n\r\n> I do like the intent of this PR, but I am now hesitant to merge it\r\n\r\nI'm not only okay with that, but I'm really happy with that. My intention was to open a discussion bringing a practical substrate to it.\r\n\r\n> We are adding quite a bit of dependency\r\n\r\nI think we're trading dependencies here, more than adding. The biggest fault of this PR, in my opinion, is that it moves from one dep from another w/o layering them with first party _wrappers_. Wrappers would be a refactoring pattern making possible to plug in/out external deps or first party code w/o touching other parts of code. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/light-service/inflector.rb\r\n\r\nrequire \"dry/inflector\"\r\n\r\nmodule LightService\r\n  class Inflector\r\n    attr_reader :inflector\r\n\r\n    def initialize\r\n      @inflector = Dry::Inflector.new\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def unerscore(string)\r\n      inflector.underscore(string)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def pluralize(string)\r\n      inflector.underscore(string)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/light-service/localization_adapter.rb\r\n\r\nmodule LightService\r\n  class LocalizationAdapter\r\n    attr_reader :inflector\r\n\r\n    def initialize\r\n      @inflector = LightService::Inflector\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # [...]\r\n\r\n    def i18n_scope_from_class(action_class, type)\r\n      \"#{inflector.underscore(action_class.name)}.light_service.#{inflector.pluralize(type.to_s)}\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way we'd be able to swap in/out different external deps or get rid of them and write our own or anything we'd like to, with a single point of responsibility\r\n\r\n> I wonder if we should keep this PR open, create a new gem light-service-rails, extract the Rails generator dependencies into that, and then merge this PR\r\n\r\nThat path would be for sure the more profitable one.\r\n\r\nCurrent PR had just the goal to make things move forward given the actual code base and to poll the interest around the proposed mid-term goal. \r\n\r\nKeep this one open as draft and we'll understand if it will be better to update it or to close it for a new one.\r\n\r\n> I am happy to create a new repo for light-service-rails, I am not sure if I'd create a new organization for it yet. I'd be happy to add you as maintainer to this new project if you're willing to help me extract the Rails and AS dependencies. What do you think?\r\n\r\n- don't bother to go for the org atm: let's do some work and then you'll think about organizational matters\r\n- I'll be happy to help until the end of September; then my baby-girl will come to the world and I'm ready to bet I'll need to take a pause from free-time work for a while :)\r\n- let's check for @gee-forr availability to help too; even just as reviewer. As original author of generator's code and as active user of the feature he may be a great booster",

They were introduced recently in https://github.com/adomokos/light-service/pull/194. Thus I cannot afford to remove ActiveSupport with a one-shot PR. Nor I want to take decisions about how to continue from now on w/o including maintainer and community into the discussion.\r\n\r\n**Is it worth to add more dependencies w/o removing ActiveSupport?**\r\n\r\nIdeally not, but from a transitional perspective, yes. Now we have a single well scoped feature requiring ActiveSupport instead of having code bites spread all over the code base.\r\nI'm bringing the gem in a more free and easier to manage position in regard of AS dep.\r\n\r\n**What about the two new dependencies?**\r\n\r\nI added https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-inflector/ and https://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings\r\n\r\nBoth were choosen because they are small, dependency-free gems with single functionality.\r\n\r\n`dry-inflector` is from the (beloved by me) dry-rb ecosystem (https://dry-rb.org/). Neat, iper-atomic and well written. It is the Hanami inflector.\r\n\r\n`structured_warnings` is a neat, very small gem; it has not been updated recently, but IMO it doesn't need to be. It works on  ruby 3.1 and its approach is simple and far (FAR) less polluting than ActiveSupport's one. I was able to implement a custom matcher for `rspec` too, writing expressive tests. Moreover its interface made possible to do a surgical substitution in the actual code base.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, being the maintainer of the project, I'd think about splitting rails generators into a separate gem. This would enclose ActiveSupport and Rails-only things in cleaner context, easier to maintain. And the test suite of the \"core\" gem would lose all the complexity inherent to testing against all the possible AS versions.\r\n\r\nI thought to open this one as a draft, but I decided to concretely propose something :) No problem turning it into draft or to use this just as a discussion desk and then close it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.

How hard would it be not to introduce two (albeit small) gems to light-service, but leverage pure Ruby to accomplish this functionality? I'd love to have LS be outside gem-dependent-free if possible in the future.\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nAFAIK deprecations could be simplified down to a custom `Logger`: if my assumption would be right, then writing 1st party code would be easy. I mean \"easy\" as \"not complex\", not as \"fast\", but that's it.\r\n\r\nThe inflector instead would be different: `dry-inflector` is the smallest, most low-complexity thing I've found around. Given we don't want to use any 3rd party dep, then I'd opt for brutally copy/paste-ing the gem's `lib/` into our codebase. That's why I won't be able to design something different and more simple than that code and reinventing the wheel would be wasted time with a worse final result (since I'm honestly light years far from Luca's and Peter's design/coding skills :) )\r\n\r\nConclusion: a custom \"deprecation logger\" + a savvy copy-paste should result in a quite small and not complex goal to achieve.",

                "body": "@martin-josef as far as your report is a really complete one, it's hard to track it down as a bug.\r\n\r\nIt's not reproducible, as you reported. What we probably have is a behavior in Wordmove that your current hosting provider dislikes.\r\n\r\nI can't elaborate a solution but I have a previous experience to share; Wordmove has a somewhat defective behavior when working w/ DB: it makes a lot of subsequent connections. Sometimes hosting providers set a throttle limit in order to protect themselves from ddos-like attempts and this limit could happen to resolve into a refute to auth the user.\r\n\r\nOne desperate try to do in order to verify this assumption is to add these configs to the specific host into your ssh config\r\n\r\n```\r\nHost example.com\r\n  ControlMaster auto\r\n  ControlPath /tmp/master-%r@%h:%p\r\n  [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen in one terminal open an SSH connection to the host and in another terminal run `wordmove pull -e production -d`. This way you should force SSH client to reuse a single connection through a local socket (don't know if it's actually a socket, but at least it has a similar concept).\r\n\r\nIs this a fix? It is not for sure. It's more of a troubleshooting/possible workaround/reproduction path, but that's all I have on the table.",

They were introduced recently in https://github.com/adomokos/light-service/pull/194. Thus I cannot afford to remove ActiveSupport with a one-shot PR. Nor I want to take decisions about how to continue from now on w/o including maintainer and community into the discussion.\r\n\r\n**Is it worth to add more dependencies w/o removing ActiveSupport?**\r\n\r\nIdeally not, but from a transitional perspective, yes. Now we have a single well scoped feature requiring ActiveSupport instead of having code bites spread all over the code base.\r\nI'm bringing the gem in a more free and easier to manage position in regard of AS dep.\r\n\r\n**What about the two new dependencies?**\r\n\r\nI added https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-inflector/ and https://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings\r\n\r\nBoth were choosen because they are small, dependency-free gems with single functionality.\r\n\r\n`dry-inflector` is from the (beloved by me) dry-rb ecosystem (https://dry-rb.org/). Neat, iper-atomic and well written. It is the Hanami inflector.\r\n\r\n`structured_warnings` is a neat, very small gem; it has not been updated recently, but IMO it doesn't need to be. It works on  ruby 3.1 and its approach is simple and far (FAR) less polluting than ActiveSupport's one. I was able to implement a custom matcher for `rspec` too, writing expressive tests. Moreover its interface made possible to do a surgical substitution in the actual code base.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, being the maintainer of the project, I'd think about splitting rails generators into a separate gem. This would enclose ActiveSupport and Rails-only things in cleaner context, easier to maintain. And the test suite of the \"core\" gem would lose all the complexity inherent to testing against all the possible AS versions.\r\n\r\nI thought to open this one as a draft, but I decided to concretely propose something :) No problem turning it into draft or to use this just as a discussion desk and then close it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.

                "body": "I like to re-underline that `i18n` here is not added, but just made explicit: it's already an [AS's dependency](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activesupport/activesupport.gemspec). As it stands it's just a peer dependence through AS but it is explicitly used for failure message translation. Having it as a direct dependence was a way to underline the fact that even in the will to remove AS we'll have to retain `i18n`.\r\n\r\nIMO we should be able to avoid `i18n` dependency too, making it opt-in: if an implementor would like to use translated messages she should add `i18n` to her bundle and LS would pick it up automatically. If absent and a `Symbol` is passed as failure message, LS could drop a warning ad just `.to_s` the symbol.\r\n\r\nI know this i18n-related discourse may seem OT, but I consider part of the \"dependent-free\" path you are picturing.\r\n\r\nComing on the spot of your comment now :)\r\n\r\n> I do like the intent of this PR, but I am now hesitant to merge it\r\n\r\nI'm not only okay with that, but I'm really happy with that. My intention was to open a discussion bringing a practical substrate to it.\r\n\r\n> We are adding quite a bit of dependency\r\n\r\nI think we're trading dependencies here, more than adding. The biggest fault of this PR, in my opinion, is that it moves from one dep from another w/o layering them with first party _wrappers_. Wrappers would be a refactoring pattern making possible to plug in/out external deps or first party code w/o touching other parts of code. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/light-service/inflector.rb\r\n\r\nrequire \"dry/inflector\"\r\n\r\nmodule LightService\r\n  class Inflector\r\n    attr_reader :inflector\r\n\r\n    def initialize\r\n      @inflector = Dry::Inflector.new\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def unerscore(string)\r\n      inflector.underscore(string)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def pluralize(string)\r\n      inflector.underscore(string)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/light-service/localization_adapter.rb\r\n\r\nmodule LightService\r\n  class LocalizationAdapter\r\n    attr_reader :inflector\r\n\r\n    def initialize\r\n      @inflector = LightService::Inflector\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # [...]\r\n\r\n    def i18n_scope_from_class(action_class, type)\r\n      \"#{inflector.underscore(action_class.name)}.light_service.#{inflector.pluralize(type.to_s)}\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way we'd be able to swap in/out different external deps or get rid of them and write our own or anything we'd like to, with a single point of responsibility\r\n\r\n> I wonder if we should keep this PR open, create a new gem light-service-rails, extract the Rails generator dependencies into that, and then merge this PR\r\n\r\nThat path would be for sure the more profitable one.\r\n\r\nCurrent PR had just the goal to make things move forward given the actual code base and to poll the interest around the proposed mid-term goal. \r\n\r\nKeep this one open as draft and we'll understand if it will be better to update it or to close it for a new one.\r\n\r\n> I am happy to create a new repo for light-service-rails, I am not sure if I'd create a new organization for it yet. I'd be happy to add you as maintainer to this new project if you're willing to help me extract the Rails and AS dependencies. What do you think?\r\n\r\n- don't bother to go for the org atm: let's do some work and then you'll think about organizational matters\r\n- I'll be happy to help until the end of September; then my baby-girl will come to the world and I'm ready to bet I'll need to take a pause from free-time work for a while :)\r\n- let's check for @gee-forr availability to help too; even just as reviewer. As original author of generator's code and as active user of the feature he may be a great booster",

They were introduced recently in https://github.com/adomokos/light-service/pull/194. Thus I cannot afford to remove ActiveSupport with a one-shot PR. Nor I want to take decisions about how to continue from now on w/o including maintainer and community into the discussion.\r\n\r\n**Is it worth to add more dependencies w/o removing ActiveSupport?**\r\n\r\nIdeally not, but from a transitional perspective, yes. Now we have a single well scoped feature requiring ActiveSupport instead of having code bites spread all over the code base.\r\nI'm bringing the gem in a more free and easier to manage position in regard of AS dep.\r\n\r\n**What about the two new dependencies?**\r\n\r\nI added https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-inflector/ and https://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings\r\n\r\nBoth were choosen because they are small, dependency-free gems with single functionality.\r\n\r\n`dry-inflector` is from the (beloved by me) dry-rb ecosystem (https://dry-rb.org/). Neat, iper-atomic and well written. It is the Hanami inflector.\r\n\r\n`structured_warnings` is a neat, very small gem; it has not been updated recently, but IMO it doesn't need to be. It works on  ruby 3.1 and its approach is simple and far (FAR) less polluting than ActiveSupport's one. I was able to implement a custom matcher for `rspec` too, writing expressive tests. Moreover its interface made possible to do a surgical substitution in the actual code base.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, being the maintainer of the project, I'd think about splitting rails generators into a separate gem. This would enclose ActiveSupport and Rails-only things in cleaner context, easier to maintain. And the test suite of the \"core\" gem would lose all the complexity inherent to testing against all the possible AS versions.\r\n\r\nI thought to open this one as a draft, but I decided to concretely propose something :) No problem turning it into draft or to use this just as a discussion desk and then close it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.

How hard would it be not to introduce two (albeit small) gems to light-service, but leverage pure Ruby to accomplish this functionality? I'd love to have LS be outside gem-dependent-free if possible in the future.\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nAFAIK deprecations could be simplified down to a custom `Logger`: if my assumption would be right, then writing 1st party code would be easy. I mean \"easy\" as \"not complex\", not as \"fast\", but that's it.\r\n\r\nThe inflector instead would be different: `dry-inflector` is the smallest, most low-complexity thing I've found around. Given we don't want to use any 3rd party dep, then I'd opt for brutally copy/paste-ing the gem's `lib/` into our codebase. That's why I won't be able to design something different and more simple than that code and reinventing the wheel would be wasted time with a worse final result (since I'm honestly light years far from Luca's and Peter's design/coding skills :) )\r\n\r\nConclusion: a custom \"deprecation logger\" + a savvy copy-paste should result in a quite small and not complex goal to achieve.",

                "body": "@martin-josef as far as your report is a really complete one, it's hard to track it down as a bug.\r\n\r\nIt's not reproducible, as you reported. What we probably have is a behavior in Wordmove that your current hosting provider dislikes.\r\n\r\nI can't elaborate a solution but I have a previous experience to share; Wordmove has a somewhat defective behavior when working w/ DB: it makes a lot of subsequent connections. Sometimes hosting providers set a throttle limit in order to protect themselves from ddos-like attempts and this limit could happen to resolve into a refute to auth the user.\r\n\r\nOne desperate try to do in order to verify this assumption is to add these configs to the specific host into your ssh config\r\n\r\n```\r\nHost example.com\r\n  ControlMaster auto\r\n  ControlPath /tmp/master-%r@%h:%p\r\n  [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen in one terminal open an SSH connection to the host and in another terminal run `wordmove pull -e production -d`. This way you should force SSH client to reuse a single connection through a local socket (don't know if it's actually a socket, but at least it has a similar concept).\r\n\r\nIs this a fix? It is not for sure. It's more of a troubleshooting/possible workaround/reproduction path, but that's all I have on the table.",

They were introduced recently in https://github.com/adomokos/light-service/pull/194. Thus I cannot afford to remove ActiveSupport with a one-shot PR. Nor I want to take decisions about how to continue from now on w/o including maintainer and community into the discussion.\r\n\r\n**Is it worth to add more dependencies w/o removing ActiveSupport?**\r\n\r\nIdeally not, but from a transitional perspective, yes. Now we have a single well scoped feature requiring ActiveSupport instead of having code bites spread all over the code base.\r\nI'm bringing the gem in a more free and easier to manage position in regard of AS dep.\r\n\r\n**What about the two new dependencies?**\r\n\r\nI added https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-inflector/ and https://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings\r\n\r\nBoth were choosen because they are small, dependency-free gems with single functionality.\r\n\r\n`dry-inflector` is from the (beloved by me) dry-rb ecosystem (https://dry-rb.org/). Neat, iper-atomic and well written. It is the Hanami inflector.\r\n\r\n`structured_warnings` is a neat, very small gem; it has not been updated recently, but IMO it doesn't need to be. It works on  ruby 3.1 and its approach is simple and far (FAR) less polluting than ActiveSupport's one. I was able to implement a custom matcher for `rspec` too, writing expressive tests. Moreover its interface made possible to do a surgical substitution in the actual code base.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, being the maintainer of the project, I'd think about splitting rails generators into a separate gem. This would enclose ActiveSupport and Rails-only things in cleaner context, easier to maintain. And the test suite of the \"core\" gem would lose all the complexity inherent to testing against all the possible AS versions.\r\n\r\nI thought to open this one as a draft, but I decided to concretely propose something :) No problem turning it into draft or to use this just as a discussion desk and then close it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.

                "body": "I like to re-underline that `i18n` here is not added, but just made explicit: it's already an [AS's dependency](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activesupport/activesupport.gemspec). As it stands it's just a peer dependence through AS but it is explicitly used for failure message translation. Having it as a direct dependence was a way to underline the fact that even in the will to remove AS we'll have to retain `i18n`.\r\n\r\nIMO we should be able to avoid `i18n` dependency too, making it opt-in: if an implementor would like to use translated messages she should add `i18n` to her bundle and LS would pick it up automatically. If absent and a `Symbol` is passed as failure message, LS could drop a warning ad just `.to_s` the symbol.\r\n\r\nI know this i18n-related discourse may seem OT, but I consider part of the \"dependent-free\" path you are picturing.\r\n\r\nComing on the spot of your comment now :)\r\n\r\n> I do like the intent of this PR, but I am now hesitant to merge it\r\n\r\nI'm not only okay with that, but I'm really happy with that. My intention was to open a discussion bringing a practical substrate to it.\r\n\r\n> We are adding quite a bit of dependency\r\n\r\nI think we're trading dependencies here, more than adding. The biggest fault of this PR, in my opinion, is that it moves from one dep from another w/o layering them with first party _wrappers_. Wrappers would be a refactoring pattern making possible to plug in/out external deps or first party code w/o touching other parts of code. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/light-service/inflector.rb\r\n\r\nrequire \"dry/inflector\"\r\n\r\nmodule LightService\r\n  class Inflector\r\n    attr_reader :inflector\r\n\r\n    def initialize\r\n      @inflector = Dry::Inflector.new\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def unerscore(string)\r\n      inflector.underscore(string)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def pluralize(string)\r\n      inflector.underscore(string)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/light-service/localization_adapter.rb\r\n\r\nmodule LightService\r\n  class LocalizationAdapter\r\n    attr_reader :inflector\r\n\r\n    def initialize\r\n      @inflector = LightService::Inflector\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # [...]\r\n\r\n    def i18n_scope_from_class(action_class, type)\r\n      \"#{inflector.underscore(action_class.name)}.light_service.#{inflector.pluralize(type.to_s)}\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way we'd be able to swap in/out different external deps or get rid of them and write our own or anything we'd like to, with a single point of responsibility\r\n\r\n> I wonder if we should keep this PR open, create a new gem light-service-rails, extract the Rails generator dependencies into that, and then merge this PR\r\n\r\nThat path would be for sure the more profitable one.\r\n\r\nCurrent PR had just the goal to make things move forward given the actual code base and to poll the interest around the proposed mid-term goal. \r\n\r\nKeep this one open as draft and we'll understand if it will be better to update it or to close it for a new one.\r\n\r\n> I am happy to create a new repo for light-service-rails, I am not sure if I'd create a new organization for it yet. I'd be happy to add you as maintainer to this new project if you're willing to help me extract the Rails and AS dependencies. What do you think?\r\n\r\n- don't bother to go for the org atm: let's do some work and then you'll think about organizational matters\r\n- I'll be happy to help until the end of September; then my baby-girl will come to the world and I'm ready to bet I'll need to take a pause from free-time work for a while :)\r\n- let's check for @gee-forr availability to help too; even just as reviewer. As original author of generator's code and as active user of the feature he may be a great booster",

They were introduced recently in https://github.com/adomokos/light-service/pull/194. Thus I cannot afford to remove ActiveSupport with a one-shot PR. Nor I want to take decisions about how to continue from now on w/o including maintainer and community into the discussion.\r\n\r\n**Is it worth to add more dependencies w/o removing ActiveSupport?**\r\n\r\nIdeally not, but from a transitional perspective, yes. Now we have a single well scoped feature requiring ActiveSupport instead of having code bites spread all over the code base.\r\nI'm bringing the gem in a more free and easier to manage position in regard of AS dep.\r\n\r\n**What about the two new dependencies?**\r\n\r\nI added https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-inflector/ and https://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings\r\n\r\nBoth were choosen because they are small, dependency-free gems with single functionality.\r\n\r\n`dry-inflector` is from the (beloved by me) dry-rb ecosystem (https://dry-rb.org/). Neat, iper-atomic and well written. It is the Hanami inflector.\r\n\r\n`structured_warnings` is a neat, very small gem; it has not been updated recently, but IMO it doesn't need to be. It works on  ruby 3.1 and its approach is simple and far (FAR) less polluting than ActiveSupport's one. I was able to implement a custom matcher for `rspec` too, writing expressive tests. Moreover its interface made possible to do a surgical substitution in the actual code base.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, being the maintainer of the project, I'd think about splitting rails generators into a separate gem. This would enclose ActiveSupport and Rails-only things in cleaner context, easier to maintain. And the test suite of the \"core\" gem would lose all the complexity inherent to testing against all the possible AS versions.\r\n\r\nI thought to open this one as a draft, but I decided to concretely propose something :) No problem turning it into draft or to use this just as a discussion desk and then close it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.

How hard would it be not to introduce two (albeit small) gems to light-service, but leverage pure Ruby to accomplish this functionality? I'd love to have LS be outside gem-dependent-free if possible in the future.\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nAFAIK deprecations could be simplified down to a custom `Logger`: if my assumption would be right, then writing 1st party code would be easy. I mean \"easy\" as \"not complex\", not as \"fast\", but that's it.\r\n\r\nThe inflector instead would be different: `dry-inflector` is the smallest, most low-complexity thing I've found around. Given we don't want to use any 3rd party dep, then I'd opt for brutally copy/paste-ing the gem's `lib/` into our codebase. That's why I won't be able to design something different and more simple than that code and reinventing the wheel would be wasted time with a worse final result (since I'm honestly light years far from Luca's and Peter's design/coding skills :) )\r\n\r\nConclusion: a custom \"deprecation logger\" + a savvy copy-paste should result in a quite small and not complex goal to achieve.",
