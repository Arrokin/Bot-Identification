You can help here!\r\n  \r\n  By reviewing another pull request, you will help raise the code quality of\r\n  that pull request and the final review will be faster. This way the general\r\n  pace of pull request reviews will go up and your wait time will go down.\r\n  \r\n  When picking a pull request to review, try to choose one that hasn't yet\r\n  been reviewed.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping out!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo help with the load of incoming pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have reviewed two other [open pull requests][prs] in this repository.\r\n\r\n[prs]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-author%3A%40me+-draft%3Atrue+-label%3Awaiting-for-upstream+sort%3Acreated-desc+review%3Anone+-status%3Afailure\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Thank you for contributing <3\r\n\r\n  Below, some useful links you could explore:\r\n-->\r\n[dev-checklist]: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/development_checklist.html\r\n[manifest-docs]: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_integration_manifest.html\r\n[quality-scale]: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/next/integration_quality_scale_index.html\r\n[docs-repository]: https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io\r\n",

                "body": "### The problem\n\nThe iBeacon Tracker distance measurement is incorrectly flagging the beacon as far away one minute (over 4 meters in my automation), then about a minute later is showing it as very nearby (under 2 meters in my automation). The beacon is sitting 12 inches away from the HA. I am not using any ESP for tracking, just the HA.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the scanner is seeing single inaccurate RSSI numbers and based on that single number, marking the beacon as far away enough to turn off my Shelly plug. This is actually very normal behavior from just about every scanner or smartphone I have ever tested. Beacon scanners will sometimes measure signal strength for one or two RSSIs inaccurately. Why? It's complicated and there seems to me no way to avoid this. Here's a link with some good data about this:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wouterbulten.nl/blog/tech/kalman-filters-explained-removing-noise-from-rssi-signals/\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is the intergation code should watch the RSSI figures, and if it sees a \"wacky\" one that is more that 10 less than the one before, it should adjust that figure for that single RSSI measurement to \"no more than 10 less than the one before.\"\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\nScanner measures RSSI signal received from beacon and sees this string of numbers over time -50 -48 -40 -43 -47 **-65** -49 -53 -50 etc. \r\n\r\nThe -65 was an aberration, probably caused by a signal collision or interference or a poltergeist. \r\n\r\nSo I would suggest that the code can adjust this -65 figure to -57 in this case, i.e. only 10 less than the one before (the -47). Call this a \"smoothing factor\" or whatever. Would be cool if users could adjust this to suit their tastes. \r\n\r\nThere are other ways to attack this signal wavering (e.g. Kalman filters), but they're complicated, and I have found that my \"dumb\" adjustment method works fine. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I have never seen any significant number of aberrant RSSI figures in the upwards direction, i.e. I haven't seen this happening before on any scanner: -50 -48 -40 -43 -47 **-25** -49 -53 -50 etc. So the simple 10 adjustment only needs to be coded for one direction of aberrant RSSI figures. \n\n### What version of Home Assistant Core has the issue?\n\n2022.10.3\n\n### What was the last working version of Home Assistant Core?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What type of installation are you running?\n\nHome Assistant OS\n\n### Integration causing the issue\n\niBeacon Tracker\n\n### Link to integration documentation on our website\n\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ibeacon\n\n### Diagnostics information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Example YAML snippet\n\n```yaml\nRunning two simple automations.

                "body": "\nHello @RedSolos,\n\nWhen attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).\n\nThe commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:\n\n\n- [`f0f0fdeb22f4e46d4071a3fc4cb6d587f03d8b38`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/f0f0fdeb22f4e46d4071a3fc4cb6d587f03d8b38) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201ccarfagna.nicola@gmail.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\n- [`15a51b0f16808bb5e4ccd969d0b96295974410fe`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/15a51b0f16808bb5e4ccd969d0b96295974410fe) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201ccarfagna.nicola@gmail.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\n- [`f7d1b71f8b7b16617add690c51475bb45c806378`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/f7d1b71f8b7b16617add690c51475bb45c806378) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201c52665281+RedSolos@users.noreply.github.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\nUnfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**\n\nHere are your options:\n\n1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).\n\n2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).\n   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run\n      ```\n      git commit --amend --author=\"Author Name <email@address.com>\"\n      ```\n      (substituting \"Author Name\" and \"`email@address.com`\" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.\n   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:\n       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.\n       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.\n   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.\n\nWe apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.\n\nThanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:\n",

See issue: https://github.com/flz/iaqualink-py/issues/26\r\n\r\nUntil either the wheel on PyPI is fixed or we can update to `v0.5.0` CI jobs for pylint and pytest are broken.

                "body": "### The problem\n\nThe iBeacon Tracker distance measurement is incorrectly flagging the beacon as far away one minute (over 4 meters in my automation), then about a minute later is showing it as very nearby (under 2 meters in my automation). The beacon is sitting 12 inches away from the HA. I am not using any ESP for tracking, just the HA.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the scanner is seeing single inaccurate RSSI numbers and based on that single number, marking the beacon as far away enough to turn off my Shelly plug. This is actually very normal behavior from just about every scanner or smartphone I have ever tested. Beacon scanners will sometimes measure signal strength for one or two RSSIs inaccurately. Why? It's complicated and there seems to me no way to avoid this. Here's a link with some good data about this:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wouterbulten.nl/blog/tech/kalman-filters-explained-removing-noise-from-rssi-signals/\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is the intergation code should watch the RSSI figures, and if it sees a \"wacky\" one that is more that 10 less than the one before, it should adjust that figure for that single RSSI measurement to \"no more than 10 less than the one before.\"\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\nScanner measures RSSI signal received from beacon and sees this string of numbers over time -50 -48 -40 -43 -47 **-65** -49 -53 -50 etc. \r\n\r\nThe -65 was an aberration, probably caused by a signal collision or interference or a poltergeist. \r\n\r\nSo I would suggest that the code can adjust this -65 figure to -57 in this case, i.e. only 10 less than the one before (the -47). Call this a \"smoothing factor\" or whatever. Would be cool if users could adjust this to suit their tastes. \r\n\r\nThere are other ways to attack this signal wavering (e.g. Kalman filters), but they're complicated, and I have found that my \"dumb\" adjustment method works fine. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I have never seen any significant number of aberrant RSSI figures in the upwards direction, i.e. I haven't seen this happening before on any scanner: -50 -48 -40 -43 -47 **-25** -49 -53 -50 etc. So the simple 10 adjustment only needs to be coded for one direction of aberrant RSSI figures. \n\n### What version of Home Assistant Core has the issue?\n\n2022.10.3\n\n### What was the last working version of Home Assistant Core?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What type of installation are you running?\n\nHome Assistant OS\n\n### Integration causing the issue\n\niBeacon Tracker\n\n### Link to integration documentation on our website\n\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ibeacon\n\n### Diagnostics information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Example YAML snippet\n\n```yaml\nRunning two simple automations.

                "body": "\nHello @RedSolos,\n\nWhen attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).\n\nThe commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:\n\n\n- [`f0f0fdeb22f4e46d4071a3fc4cb6d587f03d8b38`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/f0f0fdeb22f4e46d4071a3fc4cb6d587f03d8b38) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201ccarfagna.nicola@gmail.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\n- [`15a51b0f16808bb5e4ccd969d0b96295974410fe`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/15a51b0f16808bb5e4ccd969d0b96295974410fe) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201ccarfagna.nicola@gmail.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\n- [`f7d1b71f8b7b16617add690c51475bb45c806378`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/f7d1b71f8b7b16617add690c51475bb45c806378) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201c52665281+RedSolos@users.noreply.github.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\nUnfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**\n\nHere are your options:\n\n1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).\n\n2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).\n   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run\n      ```\n      git commit --amend --author=\"Author Name <email@address.com>\"\n      ```\n      (substituting \"Author Name\" and \"`email@address.com`\" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.\n   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:\n       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.\n       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.\n   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.\n\nWe apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.\n\nThanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:\n",

See issue: https://github.com/flz/iaqualink-py/issues/26\r\n\r\nUntil either the wheel on PyPI is fixed or we can update to `v0.5.0` CI jobs for pylint and pytest are broken. Luckily the source distribution is still available to fall back to. The `v0.5.0` update seems to require a bit more work, the changes are quite extensive, which is why I didn't choose to do that. https://github.com/flz/iaqualink-py/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0\r\n\r\nThe change isn't pretty, but it works and can be reverted once it's fixed.\r\n\r\n**Broken CI run**\r\npylint: https://github.com/cdce8p/ha-core/actions/runs/3242632837/jobs/5316195811\r\npytest: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/actions/runs/3242542140/jobs/5316055187\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.

                "body": "### The problem\n\nThe iBeacon Tracker distance measurement is incorrectly flagging the beacon as far away one minute (over 4 meters in my automation), then about a minute later is showing it as very nearby (under 2 meters in my automation). The beacon is sitting 12 inches away from the HA. I am not using any ESP for tracking, just the HA.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the scanner is seeing single inaccurate RSSI numbers and based on that single number, marking the beacon as far away enough to turn off my Shelly plug. This is actually very normal behavior from just about every scanner or smartphone I have ever tested. Beacon scanners will sometimes measure signal strength for one or two RSSIs inaccurately. Why? It's complicated and there seems to me no way to avoid this. Here's a link with some good data about this:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wouterbulten.nl/blog/tech/kalman-filters-explained-removing-noise-from-rssi-signals/\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is the intergation code should watch the RSSI figures, and if it sees a \"wacky\" one that is more that 10 less than the one before, it should adjust that figure for that single RSSI measurement to \"no more than 10 less than the one before.\"\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\nScanner measures RSSI signal received from beacon and sees this string of numbers over time -50 -48 -40 -43 -47 **-65** -49 -53 -50 etc. \r\n\r\nThe -65 was an aberration, probably caused by a signal collision or interference or a poltergeist. \r\n\r\nSo I would suggest that the code can adjust this -65 figure to -57 in this case, i.e. only 10 less than the one before (the -47). Call this a \"smoothing factor\" or whatever. Would be cool if users could adjust this to suit their tastes. \r\n\r\nThere are other ways to attack this signal wavering (e.g. Kalman filters), but they're complicated, and I have found that my \"dumb\" adjustment method works fine. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I have never seen any significant number of aberrant RSSI figures in the upwards direction, i.e. I haven't seen this happening before on any scanner: -50 -48 -40 -43 -47 **-25** -49 -53 -50 etc. So the simple 10 adjustment only needs to be coded for one direction of aberrant RSSI figures. \n\n### What version of Home Assistant Core has the issue?\n\n2022.10.3\n\n### What was the last working version of Home Assistant Core?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What type of installation are you running?\n\nHome Assistant OS\n\n### Integration causing the issue\n\niBeacon Tracker\n\n### Link to integration documentation on our website\n\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ibeacon\n\n### Diagnostics information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Example YAML snippet\n\n```yaml\nRunning two simple automations.

                "body": "\nHello @RedSolos,\n\nWhen attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).\n\nThe commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:\n\n\n- [`f0f0fdeb22f4e46d4071a3fc4cb6d587f03d8b38`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/f0f0fdeb22f4e46d4071a3fc4cb6d587f03d8b38) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201ccarfagna.nicola@gmail.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\n- [`15a51b0f16808bb5e4ccd969d0b96295974410fe`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/15a51b0f16808bb5e4ccd969d0b96295974410fe) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201ccarfagna.nicola@gmail.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\n- [`f7d1b71f8b7b16617add690c51475bb45c806378`](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/14077/commits/f7d1b71f8b7b16617add690c51475bb45c806378) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (\u201c52665281+RedSolos@users.noreply.github.com\u201d). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.\n\n\nUnfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**\n\nHere are your options:\n\n1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).\n\n2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).\n   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run\n      ```\n      git commit --amend --author=\"Author Name <email@address.com>\"\n      ```\n      (substituting \"Author Name\" and \"`email@address.com`\" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.\n   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:\n       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.\n       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.\n   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.\n\nWe apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.\n\nThanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:\n",
