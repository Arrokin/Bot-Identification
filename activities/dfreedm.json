                "body": "There seems to be a cache somewhere between the server hosting the tests (which runs this plugin) and the browsers we're testing on Sauce Labs. Without this header, this cache serves responses generated for one browser's requests to those of another browser, which may have different compliation settings.\r\n\r\nThese different browsers which seem to be having their responses mixed up are running in different OSs on different VM instances, so I don't think this cache could possibly be running anywhere on the client VM. Also, I've checked that the requests are in fact reaching the server and responses are being compiled - the response is just different by the time the browser receives it. This makes me think that the culprit is Sauce Labs Proxy, but the docs for Sauce Labs Proxy claim that it no longer caches.[^1] They also recently deprecated a `--no-proxy-caching` flag[^2], so I'm skeptical.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client>\r\n[^2]: <https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365781>\r\n\r\nSetting `Cache-Control: no-cache` can't be used to work around this because `@web/test-runner` unconditionally installs server middleware[^3] that almost always sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` in non-interactive scenarios.[^4]\r\n\r\n[^3]: `cacheMiddleware` is added before `...config.middleware`, giving it higher precedence. It also calls `await ctx.next()` _before_ doing any work, so it always runs last and overwrites any `Cache-Control` header added by any user\r\nmiddleware: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/da7901116322fc112ea45413e6be87f3f770f15e/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/TestRunnerServer.ts#L50>\r\n[^4]: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/fdcf2e59253c619aaa07938e5710f9db24841709/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts#L12>\r\n\r\nFortunately, this unknown cache seems to be responsive to the `Vary` request header. The plugin specifically uses the `User-Agent` request header to determine compilation settings, so adding `Vary: User-Agent` will cause the cache to use fresh responses for any change in the UA.",

                "body": "There seems to be a cache somewhere between the server hosting the tests (which runs this plugin) and the browsers we're testing on Sauce Labs. Without this header, this cache serves responses generated for one browser's requests to those of another browser, which may have different compliation settings.\r\n\r\nThese different browsers which seem to be having their responses mixed up are running in different OSs on different VM instances, so I don't think this cache could possibly be running anywhere on the client VM. Also, I've checked that the requests are in fact reaching the server and responses are being compiled - the response is just different by the time the browser receives it. This makes me think that the culprit is Sauce Labs Proxy, but the docs for Sauce Labs Proxy claim that it no longer caches.[^1] They also recently deprecated a `--no-proxy-caching` flag[^2], so I'm skeptical.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client>\r\n[^2]: <https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365781>\r\n\r\nSetting `Cache-Control: no-cache` can't be used to work around this because `@web/test-runner` unconditionally installs server middleware[^3] that almost always sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` in non-interactive scenarios.[^4]\r\n\r\n[^3]: `cacheMiddleware` is added before `...config.middleware`, giving it higher precedence. It also calls `await ctx.next()` _before_ doing any work, so it always runs last and overwrites any `Cache-Control` header added by any user\r\nmiddleware: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/da7901116322fc112ea45413e6be87f3f770f15e/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/TestRunnerServer.ts#L50>\r\n[^4]: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/fdcf2e59253c619aaa07938e5710f9db24841709/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts#L12>\r\n\r\nFortunately, this unknown cache seems to be responsive to the `Vary` request header. The plugin specifically uses the `User-Agent` request header to determine compilation settings, so adding `Vary: User-Agent` will cause the cache to use fresh responses for any change in the UA.",

Without this header, this cache serves responses generated for one browser's requests to those of another browser, which may have different compliation settings.\r\n\r\nThese different browsers which seem to be having their responses mixed up are running in different OSs on different VM instances, so I don't think this cache could possibly be running anywhere on the client VM. Also, I've checked that the requests are in fact reaching the server and responses are being compiled - the response is just different by the time the browser receives it. This makes me think that the culprit is Sauce Labs Proxy, but the docs for Sauce Labs Proxy claim that it no longer caches.[^1] They also recently deprecated a `--no-proxy-caching` flag[^2], so I'm skeptical.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client>\r\n[^2]: <https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365781>\r\n\r\nSetting `Cache-Control: no-cache` can't be used to work around this because `@web/test-runner` unconditionally installs server middleware[^3] that almost always sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` in non-interactive scenarios.[^4]\r\n\r\n[^3]: `cacheMiddleware` is added before `...config.middleware`, giving it higher precedence. It also calls `await ctx.next()` _before_ doing any work, so it always runs last and overwrites any `Cache-Control` header added by any user\r\nmiddleware: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/da7901116322fc112ea45413e6be87f3f770f15e/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/TestRunnerServer.ts#L50>\r\n[^4]: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/fdcf2e59253c619aaa07938e5710f9db24841709/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts#L12>\r\n\r\nFortunately, this unknown cache seems to be responsive to the `Vary` request header. The plugin specifically uses the `User-Agent` request header to determine compilation settings, so adding `Vary: User-Agent` will cause the cache to use fresh responses for any change in the UA.",
