The reason I separated them is because it makes the CI status easier to read in the case that the build succeeds but the tests fail.\r\n\r\n- The `package-lock.json` file is now checked in. I think we should start doing this, because it makes CI builds more reliable and much easier to know when a change in a dependency is what broke the build/tests, since those upgrades are tracked by Git.\r\n\r\n- Converted the package to `\"type\": \"module\"`, which is important to help tools understand that this package distributes modules, not commonjs which is the default.

I also updated `css-to-ts.js` to be a module since it is now executed as one by default (trivial change).\r\n\r\n- Upgraded dependencies.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/3773",

If `virtualenvwrapper` plugin is not present, then\n   [fallback to standard\n   `virtualenvwrapper`](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1414#issuecomment-320306421).\n3.

This bug was introduced by\nhttps://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1981/ which ensured that\nthe `pyenv` `virtualenvwrapper` plugin was activated if present,\nregardless of the presence of the `virtualenv-init` plugin.\n\nAs an optimization, the check for the `pyenv` plugins are skipped if\n`pyenv` itself isn't found.\n\nSince we only want to fallback if the `pyenv` `virtualenvwrapper` plugin\nis missing, but that's buried within the `pyenv` logic and we also need\nto handle when `pyenv` itself is missing, this switches to using a flag\nvariable.\n\nI also renamed the `virtualenv_sources` var to\n`virtualenvwrapper_sources` as `virtualenv` is distinct from\n`virtualenvwrapper`, so using one name for a var that is really about\nthe other is confusing.\n\nLooking at `git blame`, there's a _lot_ of prior art here around trying\nto support all the permutations of `pyenv` and various plugins:\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/1413\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1414\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1433\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1434\n\nSo we need to be extremely careful to continue to support all these\npermutations.\n\nFix https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/2022",

                "body": "There seems to be a cache somewhere between the server hosting the tests (which runs this plugin) and the browsers we're testing on Sauce Labs. Without this header, this cache serves responses generated for one browser's requests to those of another browser, which may have different compliation settings.\r\n\r\nThese different browsers which seem to be having their responses mixed up are running in different OSs on different VM instances, so I don't think this cache could possibly be running anywhere on the client VM. Also, I've checked that the requests are in fact reaching the server and responses are being compiled - the response is just different by the time the browser receives it. This makes me think that the culprit is Sauce Labs Proxy, but the docs for Sauce Labs Proxy claim that it no longer caches.[^1] They also recently deprecated a `--no-proxy-caching` flag[^2], so I'm skeptical.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client>\r\n[^2]: <https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365781>\r\n\r\nSetting `Cache-Control: no-cache` can't be used to work around this because `@web/test-runner` unconditionally installs server middleware[^3] that almost always sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` in non-interactive scenarios.[^4]\r\n\r\n[^3]: `cacheMiddleware` is added before `...config.middleware`, giving it higher precedence. It also calls `await ctx.next()` _before_ doing any work, so it always runs last and overwrites any `Cache-Control` header added by any user\r\nmiddleware: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/da7901116322fc112ea45413e6be87f3f770f15e/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/TestRunnerServer.ts#L50>\r\n[^4]: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/fdcf2e59253c619aaa07938e5710f9db24841709/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts#L12>\r\n\r\nFortunately, this unknown cache seems to be responsive to the `Vary` request header. The plugin specifically uses the `User-Agent` request header to determine compilation settings, so adding `Vary: User-Agent` will cause the cache to use fresh responses for any change in the UA.",

It uses https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/ with the https://github.com/blueprintui/web-test-runner-jasmine plugin. **They all pass on Chromium but not Firefox, and I didn't try Safari yet, so I'm only including Chromium for now.**\r\n\r\n- The only incompatibility with the test files are the use of `import 'jasmine'`, which is done in Google3 to make `taze` happy, but is invalid externally because the `jasmine` package is a Node-only commonjs module that can't be loaded in the browser (https://unpkg.com/browse/jasmine@4.5.0/lib/jasmine.js), so the test runner jasmine plugin is responsible for actually injecting the browser-compatible Jasmine. The copybara transform has been updated in https://github.com/material-components/material-web/commit/933cb14ac8ee02b0d3a8b36ef8045472adecfb32.\r\n\r\n- Added `build` and `test` GitHub actions, which should both pass. The reason I separated them is because it makes the CI status easier to read in the case that the build succeeds but the tests fail.\r\n\r\n- The `package-lock.json` file is now checked in. I think we should start doing this, because it makes CI builds more reliable and much easier to know when a change in a dependency is what broke the build/tests, since those upgrades are tracked by Git.\r\n\r\n- Converted the package to `\"type\": \"module\"`, which is important to help tools understand that this package distributes modules, not commonjs which is the default. I also updated `css-to-ts.js` to be a module since it is now executed as one by default (trivial change).\r\n\r\n- Upgraded dependencies.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/3773",

This bug was introduced by\nhttps://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1981/ which ensured that\nthe `pyenv` `virtualenvwrapper` plugin was activated if present,\nregardless of the presence of the `virtualenv-init` plugin.\n\nAs an optimization, the check for the `pyenv` plugins are skipped if\n`pyenv` itself isn't found.\n\nSince we only want to fallback if the `pyenv` `virtualenvwrapper` plugin\nis missing, but that's buried within the `pyenv` logic and we also need\nto handle when `pyenv` itself is missing, this switches to using a flag\nvariable.\n\nI also renamed the `virtualenv_sources` var to\n`virtualenvwrapper_sources` as `virtualenv` is distinct from\n`virtualenvwrapper`, so using one name for a var that is really about\nthe other is confusing.\n\nLooking at `git blame`, there's a _lot_ of prior art here around trying\nto support all the permutations of `pyenv` and various plugins:\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/1413\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1414\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1433\n* https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/pull/1434\n\nSo we need to be extremely careful to continue to support all these\npermutations.\n\nFix https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/2022",

Without this header, this cache serves responses generated for one browser's requests to those of another browser, which may have different compliation settings.\r\n\r\nThese different browsers which seem to be having their responses mixed up are running in different OSs on different VM instances, so I don't think this cache could possibly be running anywhere on the client VM. Also, I've checked that the requests are in fact reaching the server and responses are being compiled - the response is just different by the time the browser receives it. This makes me think that the culprit is Sauce Labs Proxy, but the docs for Sauce Labs Proxy claim that it no longer caches.[^1] They also recently deprecated a `--no-proxy-caching` flag[^2], so I'm skeptical.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client>\r\n[^2]: <https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365781>\r\n\r\nSetting `Cache-Control: no-cache` can't be used to work around this because `@web/test-runner` unconditionally installs server middleware[^3] that almost always sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` in non-interactive scenarios.[^4]\r\n\r\n[^3]: `cacheMiddleware` is added before `...config.middleware`, giving it higher precedence. It also calls `await ctx.next()` _before_ doing any work, so it always runs last and overwrites any `Cache-Control` header added by any user\r\nmiddleware: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/da7901116322fc112ea45413e6be87f3f770f15e/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/TestRunnerServer.ts#L50>\r\n[^4]: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/fdcf2e59253c619aaa07938e5710f9db24841709/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts#L12>\r\n\r\nFortunately, this unknown cache seems to be responsive to the `Vary` request header. The plugin specifically uses the `User-Agent` request header to determine compilation settings, so adding `Vary: User-Agent` will cause the cache to use fresh responses for any change in the UA.",

                "body": "- The existing Jasmine tests can now be run with `npm test`. It uses https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/ with the https://github.com/blueprintui/web-test-runner-jasmine plugin. **They all pass on Chromium but not Firefox, and I didn't try Safari yet, so I'm only including Chromium for now.**\r\n\r\n- The only incompatibility with the test files are the use of `import 'jasmine'`, which is done in Google3 to make `taze` happy, but is invalid externally because the `jasmine` package is a Node-only commonjs module that can't be loaded in the browser (https://unpkg.com/browse/jasmine@4.5.0/lib/jasmine.js), so the test runner jasmine plugin is responsible for actually injecting the browser-compatible Jasmine. The copybara transform has been updated in https://github.com/material-components/material-web/commit/933cb14ac8ee02b0d3a8b36ef8045472adecfb32.\r\n\r\n- Added `build` and `test` GitHub actions, which should both pass. The reason I separated them is because it makes the CI status easier to read in the case that the build succeeds but the tests fail.\r\n\r\n- The `package-lock.json` file is now checked in. I think we should start doing this, because it makes CI builds more reliable and much easier to know when a change in a dependency is what broke the build/tests, since those upgrades are tracked by Git.\r\n\r\n- Converted the package to `\"type\": \"module\"`, which is important to help tools understand that this package distributes modules, not commonjs which is the default. I also updated `css-to-ts.js` to be a module since it is now executed as one by default (trivial change).\r\n\r\n- Upgraded dependencies.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/3773",

It uses https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/ with the https://github.com/blueprintui/web-test-runner-jasmine plugin. **They all pass on Chromium but not Firefox, and I didn't try Safari yet, so I'm only including Chromium for now.**\r\n\r\n- The only incompatibility with the test files are the use of `import 'jasmine'`, which is done in Google3 to make `taze` happy, but is invalid externally because the `jasmine` package is a Node-only commonjs module that can't be loaded in the browser (https://unpkg.com/browse/jasmine@4.5.0/lib/jasmine.js), so the test runner jasmine plugin is responsible for actually injecting the browser-compatible Jasmine. The copybara transform has been updated in https://github.com/material-components/material-web/commit/933cb14ac8ee02b0d3a8b36ef8045472adecfb32.\r\n\r\n- Added `build` and `test` GitHub actions, which should both pass. The reason I separated them is because it makes the CI status easier to read in the case that the build succeeds but the tests fail.\r\n\r\n- The `package-lock.json` file is now checked in. I think we should start doing this, because it makes CI builds more reliable and much easier to know when a change in a dependency is what broke the build/tests, since those upgrades are tracked by Git.\r\n\r\n- Converted the package to `\"type\": \"module\"`, which is important to help tools understand that this package distributes modules, not commonjs which is the default. I also updated `css-to-ts.js` to be a module since it is now executed as one by default (trivial change).\r\n\r\n- Upgraded dependencies.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/3773",

                "body": "- The existing Jasmine tests can now be run with `npm test`. It uses https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/ with the https://github.com/blueprintui/web-test-runner-jasmine plugin. **They all pass on Chromium but not Firefox, and I didn't try Safari yet, so I'm only including Chromium for now.**\r\n\r\n- The only incompatibility with the test files are the use of `import 'jasmine'`, which is done in Google3 to make `taze` happy, but is invalid externally because the `jasmine` package is a Node-only commonjs module that can't be loaded in the browser (https://unpkg.com/browse/jasmine@4.5.0/lib/jasmine.js), so the test runner jasmine plugin is responsible for actually injecting the browser-compatible Jasmine. The copybara transform has been updated in https://github.com/material-components/material-web/commit/933cb14ac8ee02b0d3a8b36ef8045472adecfb32.\r\n\r\n- Added `build` and `test` GitHub actions, which should both pass. The reason I separated them is because it makes the CI status easier to read in the case that the build succeeds but the tests fail.\r\n\r\n- The `package-lock.json` file is now checked in. I think we should start doing this, because it makes CI builds more reliable and much easier to know when a change in a dependency is what broke the build/tests, since those upgrades are tracked by Git.\r\n\r\n- Converted the package to `\"type\": \"module\"`, which is important to help tools understand that this package distributes modules, not commonjs which is the default. I also updated `css-to-ts.js` to be a module since it is now executed as one by default (trivial change).\r\n\r\n- Upgraded dependencies.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/3773",

Without this header, this cache serves responses generated for one browser's requests to those of another browser, which may have different compliation settings.\r\n\r\nThese different browsers which seem to be having their responses mixed up are running in different OSs on different VM instances, so I don't think this cache could possibly be running anywhere on the client VM. Also, I've checked that the requests are in fact reaching the server and responses are being compiled - the response is just different by the time the browser receives it. This makes me think that the culprit is Sauce Labs Proxy, but the docs for Sauce Labs Proxy claim that it no longer caches.[^1] They also recently deprecated a `--no-proxy-caching` flag[^2], so I'm skeptical.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client>\r\n[^2]: <https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365781>\r\n\r\nSetting `Cache-Control: no-cache` can't be used to work around this because `@web/test-runner` unconditionally installs server middleware[^3] that almost always sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` in non-interactive scenarios.[^4]\r\n\r\n[^3]: `cacheMiddleware` is added before `...config.middleware`, giving it higher precedence. It also calls `await ctx.next()` _before_ doing any work, so it always runs last and overwrites any `Cache-Control` header added by any user\r\nmiddleware: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/da7901116322fc112ea45413e6be87f3f770f15e/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/TestRunnerServer.ts#L50>\r\n[^4]: <https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/fdcf2e59253c619aaa07938e5710f9db24841709/packages/test-runner-core/src/server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts#L12>\r\n\r\nFortunately, this unknown cache seems to be responsive to the `Vary` request header.
