                "body": "@mikermcneil Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

                "body": "@atex21 Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

This matters because I reuse the valuesToSet object to reset the same document multiple times in my test scripts:    For additional context, my database is a mongo db.  \r\n\r\nThe following is the initial state of valuesToSet:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  createdAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  updatedAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  id: '000000000000000000000002',\r\n  email: 'testuseraccount@gmail.com',\r\n  firstName: 'Ruby',\r\n  lastName: 'Rod',\r\n  password: '*******',\r\n  accountStatus: 'confirmed',\r\n  emailProofToken: '',\r\n  emailProofTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  passwordResetToken: '',\r\n  passwordResetTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  emailChangeCandidate: '',\r\n  stripeCustomerId: ''\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following is the valuesToSet object after it has been used in call to Model.updateOne().set(criteria, valuesToSet)\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  createdAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  updatedAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  email: 'testuseraccount@gmail.com',\r\n  firstName: 'Ruby',\r\n  lastName: 'Rod',\r\n  password: '$2b$10$V9d5ixnm9YVIR.uhsO8U0OX77XUJ1MrOcOazHYIqrzvkmTp5h/M7K',\r\n  accountStatus: 'confirmed',\r\n  emailProofToken: '',\r\n  emailProofTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  passwordResetToken: '',\r\n  passwordResetTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  emailChangeCandidate: '',\r\n  stripeCustomerId: '',\r\n  _id: ObjectID {\r\n    _bsontype: 'ObjectID',\r\n    id: Buffer(12) [Uint8Array] [\r\n      0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\r\n      0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\r\n      0, 2\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe object seems to be getting painted over by the raw object as retrieved from the Mongo database, which I don't think should happen.   If for whatever reason you deem it should happen though, at a minimum the the translation from _id to id should likely happen per the documentation.   That being said, I ultimately feel that the .set() function should not be manipulating the valuesToSet object at all.... rather it should only be manipulating the database document.\r\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

                "body": "@luislobo Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

This is an outdated practice as the newer alternatives of `let` and `const` offer more granular control over variable scoping in a way that is preferable 95+% of the time. The use of `var` in the docs gives new users the impression that sails is dated. Updating the docs to use `const` or occasionally `let` in the examples will make sails more appealing.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this PR as a one-off for a single page in the hopes of getting feedback on whether the sails team agrees that this change is appropriate before I more holistically propose changes to a broader range of sails docs to update them similarly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

This matters because I reuse the valuesToSet object to reset the same document multiple times in my test scripts:    For additional context, my database is a mongo db.  \r\n\r\nThe following is the initial state of valuesToSet:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  createdAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  updatedAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  id: '000000000000000000000002',\r\n  email: 'testuseraccount@gmail.com',\r\n  firstName: 'Ruby',\r\n  lastName: 'Rod',\r\n  password: '*******',\r\n  accountStatus: 'confirmed',\r\n  emailProofToken: '',\r\n  emailProofTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  passwordResetToken: '',\r\n  passwordResetTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  emailChangeCandidate: '',\r\n  stripeCustomerId: ''\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following is the valuesToSet object after it has been used in call to Model.updateOne().set(criteria, valuesToSet)\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  createdAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  updatedAt: 1667199444571,\r\n  email: 'testuseraccount@gmail.com',\r\n  firstName: 'Ruby',\r\n  lastName: 'Rod',\r\n  password: '$2b$10$V9d5ixnm9YVIR.uhsO8U0OX77XUJ1MrOcOazHYIqrzvkmTp5h/M7K',\r\n  accountStatus: 'confirmed',\r\n  emailProofToken: '',\r\n  emailProofTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  passwordResetToken: '',\r\n  passwordResetTokenExpiresAt: 0,\r\n  emailChangeCandidate: '',\r\n  stripeCustomerId: '',\r\n  _id: ObjectID {\r\n    _bsontype: 'ObjectID',\r\n    id: Buffer(12) [Uint8Array] [\r\n      0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\r\n      0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\r\n      0, 2\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe object seems to be getting painted over by the raw object as retrieved from the Mongo database, which I don't think should happen.   If for whatever reason you deem it should happen though, at a minimum the the translation from _id to id should likely happen per the documentation.   That being said, I ultimately feel that the .set() function should not be manipulating the valuesToSet object at all.... rather it should only be manipulating the database document.\r\n",

                "body": "@abrar71 Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

                "body": "The sails docs use `var` in most example code. This is an outdated practice as the newer alternatives of `let` and `const` offer more granular control over variable scoping in a way that is preferable 95+% of the time. The use of `var` in the docs gives new users the impression that sails is dated. Updating the docs to use `const` or occasionally `let` in the examples will make sails more appealing.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this PR as a one-off for a single page in the hopes of getting feedback on whether the sails team agrees that this change is appropriate before I more holistically propose changes to a broader range of sails docs to update them similarly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

                "body": "@mikermcneil Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

                "body": "@serebriakov19 Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

If for whatever reason you deem it should happen though, at a minimum the the translation from _id to id should likely happen per the documentation.   That being said, I ultimately feel that the .set() function should not be manipulating the valuesToSet object at all.... rather it should only be manipulating the database document.\r\n",

We'll take a look as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:\n - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_\n - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_ \n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.  Instead, [disclose it responsibly](https://sailsjs.com/security).\n\nFor help with questions about Sails, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n",

This is an outdated practice as the newer alternatives of `let` and `const` offer more granular control over variable scoping in a way that is preferable 95+% of the time. The use of `var` in the docs gives new users the impression that sails is dated. Updating the docs to use `const` or occasionally `let` in the examples will make sails more appealing.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this PR as a one-off for a single page in the hopes of getting feedback on whether the sails team agrees that this change is appropriate before I more holistically propose changes to a broader range of sails docs to update them similarly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_\n - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.\n - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_\n - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.

We'll look at it ASAP.\n\nIn the mean time, here are some ways you can help speed things along:\n - discuss this pull request with [other contributors](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) and get their feedback.  _(Reactions and comments can help us make better decisions, anticipate compatibility problems, and prevent bugs.)_\n - ask [another JavaScript developer](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails) to review the files changed in this pull request.  _(Peer reviews definitely don't guarantee perfection, but they help catch mistakes and enourage collaborative thinking.  Code reviews are so useful that some open source projects require a minimum number of reviews before even considering a merge!)_\n - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your pull request](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_\n - make sure you've answered the \"why?\"  _(Before we can review and merge a pull request, we feel it is important to fully understand the use case: the human reason these changes are important for you, your team, or your organization.)_\n<hr/>\n\nPlease remember: never post in a public forum if you believe you've found a genuine security vulnerability.
