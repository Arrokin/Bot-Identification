We've already been manually managing a 2nd Postgres-compatible schema definition to power sqlc, and that's worked ok so far. Of course we'd love to avoid doing that.\r\n\r\nMore recently, however, we've started to be hit more directly by the need for proper CockroachDB syntax support. CockroachDB's planner is fairly limited in its index selection abilities as compared to Postgres, so we often find that we need to explicitly specify the target index for a query via [index hints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/table-expressions#force-index-selection) (`SELECT FROM my_table@my_index_name`) in order for the query to take advantage of the desired index. Without this, we are unable to safely convert some legacy code to sqlc because we can't rely on CockroachDB to take advantage of the correct secondary index on its own \ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\nDefinitely count us in as a big \ud83d\udc4d for this feature :pray:",

In order to avoid bloating our feature definition JSON, we've been separating features by Project so that particular project areas can only receive the list of features _they_ care about, rather than the list of every single feature defined in the system. This works well most of the time.\r\n\r\nWhere this breaks down, though, is when we need a single feature flag to be available across multiple areas of our infrastructure. While this isn't the default, sometimes it's desirable. We might want our customer-facing user interface to be able to resolve a feature flag, as well as some deep internal subsystem that we'd consider a separate Project where features don't normally overlap.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is not covered by the existing Environments functionality. I'm referring strictly to our production environment where a given feature might have multiple Projects which it is relevant for, even though _most_ of our features would only be relevant for a single Project.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the only way to do this today would be to not assign features to projects at all, and to not filter the SDK Endpoint request by `projectId`. We're afraid this approach won't scale, because it means we'd be making many user interface feature definitions available to distant subsystems that don't care about those features or make use of them. If the relationship between Features and Projects was changed from a 1:many to a many:many relationship, this would allow us to keep the separation most of the time when we want it, but also allow us to share features between projects where appropriate.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a more concrete example would be helpful to illustrate this use case. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nNone",

                "body": "\u2026vement. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rearchitecture of `Upchunk` to use `ReadableStreams` as the basis for reading bytes from a file. Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

                "body": "There's a simple algorithm on dynamic chunk sizing at the moment: the chunk size doubles when the last chunk duration (`lastChunkInterval`) was less than 10 seconds, and it halves when the last chunk took more than 30 seconds to upload. So as-is we should only see a 512MB chunk if the client was just able to upload a 256MB chunk in < 10 seconds (25.6 MB/s / 205 Mbit/s).\r\n\r\nIf we don't scale the chunk size up, then high bandwidth clients are kneecapped by round trip time and don't really have the opportunity to hit full throughput. However there's of course a tradeoff where it starts using too much memory.\r\n\r\nHonestly 512MB is as large or larger than what I saw from any of the other sites I tested back in February. Google Drive, for example, caps out at 200MB. If there's concern that 512MB is too large, then 256MB is probably a more reasonable limit.\r\n\r\nI also worry that 256 KB is too low, but then nobody will ever hit that unless it's taking them >30 seconds to upload 512KB. Really this setting is about trying to balance upload throughput vs memory usage vs maximum amount of time lost if a chunk has to retry.",

                "body": "\u2026vement. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rearchitecture of `Upchunk` to use `ReadableStreams` as the basis for reading bytes from a file. Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

The [`ON UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/add-column#add-a-column-with-an-on-update-expression) expression caused SQL validation errors. This is specific to CRDB.\r\n2. [Hash sharded indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/hash-sharded-indexes.html) caused SQL validation errors as well\r\n3. Composite primary keys with ordering like `PRIMARY KEY(col1, col2 DESC)` said that `DESC` was an error\r\n4. The [`STORING` clause](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/create-index#parameters) was also found to be an error\r\n\r\n",

We've already been manually managing a 2nd Postgres-compatible schema definition to power sqlc, and that's worked ok so far. Of course we'd love to avoid doing that.\r\n\r\nMore recently, however, we've started to be hit more directly by the need for proper CockroachDB syntax support. CockroachDB's planner is fairly limited in its index selection abilities as compared to Postgres, so we often find that we need to explicitly specify the target index for a query via [index hints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/table-expressions#force-index-selection) (`SELECT FROM my_table@my_index_name`) in order for the query to take advantage of the desired index. Without this, we are unable to safely convert some legacy code to sqlc because we can't rely on CockroachDB to take advantage of the correct secondary index on its own \ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\nDefinitely count us in as a big \ud83d\udc4d for this feature :pray:",

In order to avoid bloating our feature definition JSON, we've been separating features by Project so that particular project areas can only receive the list of features _they_ care about, rather than the list of every single feature defined in the system. This works well most of the time.\r\n\r\nWhere this breaks down, though, is when we need a single feature flag to be available across multiple areas of our infrastructure. While this isn't the default, sometimes it's desirable. We might want our customer-facing user interface to be able to resolve a feature flag, as well as some deep internal subsystem that we'd consider a separate Project where features don't normally overlap.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is not covered by the existing Environments functionality. I'm referring strictly to our production environment where a given feature might have multiple Projects which it is relevant for, even though _most_ of our features would only be relevant for a single Project.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the only way to do this today would be to not assign features to projects at all, and to not filter the SDK Endpoint request by `projectId`. We're afraid this approach won't scale, because it means we'd be making many user interface feature definitions available to distant subsystems that don't care about those features or make use of them. If the relationship between Features and Projects was changed from a 1:many to a many:many relationship, this would allow us to keep the separation most of the time when we want it, but also allow us to share features between projects where appropriate.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a more concrete example would be helpful to illustrate this use case. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nNone",

                "body": "\u2026vement. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rearchitecture of `Upchunk` to use `ReadableStreams` as the basis for reading bytes from a file. Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

                "body": "\u2026vement. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rearchitecture of `Upchunk` to use `ReadableStreams` as the basis for reading bytes from a file. Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

                "body": "There's a simple algorithm on dynamic chunk sizing at the moment: the chunk size doubles when the last chunk duration (`lastChunkInterval`) was less than 10 seconds, and it halves when the last chunk took more than 30 seconds to upload. So as-is we should only see a 512MB chunk if the client was just able to upload a 256MB chunk in < 10 seconds (25.6 MB/s / 205 Mbit/s).\r\n\r\nIf we don't scale the chunk size up, then high bandwidth clients are kneecapped by round trip time and don't really have the opportunity to hit full throughput. However there's of course a tradeoff where it starts using too much memory.\r\n\r\nHonestly 512MB is as large or larger than what I saw from any of the other sites I tested back in February. Google Drive, for example, caps out at 200MB. If there's concern that 512MB is too large, then 256MB is probably a more reasonable limit.\r\n\r\nI also worry that 256 KB is too low, but then nobody will ever hit that unless it's taking them >30 seconds to upload 512KB. Really this setting is about trying to balance upload throughput vs memory usage vs maximum amount of time lost if a chunk has to retry.",

                "body": "\u2026vement. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rearchitecture of `Upchunk` to use `ReadableStreams` as the basis for reading bytes from a file. Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

                "body": "\u2026vement. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rearchitecture of `Upchunk` to use `ReadableStreams` as the basis for reading bytes from a file. Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

We've already been manually managing a 2nd Postgres-compatible schema definition to power sqlc, and that's worked ok so far. Of course we'd love to avoid doing that.\r\n\r\nMore recently, however, we've started to be hit more directly by the need for proper CockroachDB syntax support. CockroachDB's planner is fairly limited in its index selection abilities as compared to Postgres, so we often find that we need to explicitly specify the target index for a query via [index hints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/table-expressions#force-index-selection) (`SELECT FROM my_table@my_index_name`) in order for the query to take advantage of the desired index. Without this, we are unable to safely convert some legacy code to sqlc because we can't rely on CockroachDB to take advantage of the correct secondary index on its own \ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\nDefinitely count us in as a big \ud83d\udc4d for this feature :pray:",

                "body": "### Description of Feature\r\n\r\nWe run complex infrastructure with multiple product areas. These are architecturally separated, and sometimes live in different datacenters. In order to avoid bloating our feature definition JSON, we've been separating features by Project so that particular project areas can only receive the list of features _they_ care about, rather than the list of every single feature defined in the system. This works well most of the time.\r\n\r\nWhere this breaks down, though, is when we need a single feature flag to be available across multiple areas of our infrastructure. While this isn't the default, sometimes it's desirable. We might want our customer-facing user interface to be able to resolve a feature flag, as well as some deep internal subsystem that we'd consider a separate Project where features don't normally overlap.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is not covered by the existing Environments functionality. I'm referring strictly to our production environment where a given feature might have multiple Projects which it is relevant for, even though _most_ of our features would only be relevant for a single Project.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the only way to do this today would be to not assign features to projects at all, and to not filter the SDK Endpoint request by `projectId`. We're afraid this approach won't scale, because it means we'd be making many user interface feature definitions available to distant subsystems that don't care about those features or make use of them. If the relationship between Features and Projects was changed from a 1:many to a many:many relationship, this would allow us to keep the separation most of the time when we want it, but also allow us to share features between projects where appropriate.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a more concrete example would be helpful to illustrate this use case. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nNone",

Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

                "body": "There's a simple algorithm on dynamic chunk sizing at the moment: the chunk size doubles when the last chunk duration (`lastChunkInterval`) was less than 10 seconds, and it halves when the last chunk took more than 30 seconds to upload. So as-is we should only see a 512MB chunk if the client was just able to upload a 256MB chunk in < 10 seconds (25.6 MB/s / 205 Mbit/s).\r\n\r\nIf we don't scale the chunk size up, then high bandwidth clients are kneecapped by round trip time and don't really have the opportunity to hit full throughput. However there's of course a tradeoff where it starts using too much memory.\r\n\r\nHonestly 512MB is as large or larger than what I saw from any of the other sites I tested back in February. Google Drive, for example, caps out at 200MB. If there's concern that 512MB is too large, then 256MB is probably a more reasonable limit.\r\n\r\nI also worry that 256 KB is too low, but then nobody will ever hit that unless it's taking them >30 seconds to upload 512KB. Really this setting is about trying to balance upload throughput vs memory usage vs maximum amount of time lost if a chunk has to retry.",

Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",

Unlike the current implementation, which relies on loading the entire file into the JavaScript runtime heap, this new architecture allows us to reduce the memory footprint to a given `read()` from the file's `ReadableStream` (plus any remaining bytes from the previous read that have yet to be uploaded).\r\n\r\n### Why a separate `AsyncIterable` class (`ChunkedStreamIterable`)?\r\n\r\nWhile the code could have been entirely written inline as part of the `UpChunk` instance, creating a class that conforms to ECMA standards for async iteration allows us to:\r\n* Take advantage of constructs like iterators, making the asynchronous, serial process of chunked upload much simpler and easier to understand in its use in `UpChunk::sendChunks()`.\r\n* Have clear separation of concerns, leaving room for more granular/unit-level testing and isolating some of the more complicated parts when refactoring/reasoning about functionality, since `ChunkedStreamIterable` shouldn't need to be refactored as frequently. \r\n* Have a much easier path forward for plausible future features, like direct `MediaRecorder` support.\r\n* Have a much easier path forward for alternative application of chunked uploads (e.g. `WebSockets` or `WebRTC` data channels, transforms, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why a \"pull\"-based use of streams (instead of a \"push\")\r\n\r\nUsing things like [`pipes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#pipe_chains) with [`backpressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#backpressure) can often be a very clean way to chain together discrete transformations and side effects when working with streams. Unfortunately, the current APIs don't have sufficient ways of cleanly handling:\r\n* pauses (in a way that wouldn't result in aggregation of file bytes into memory)\r\n* dynamic queuing strategies to apply appropriate backpressure (e.g. with `dynamicChunkSize` enabled)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of changes here, additional tests have been added to validate that the \"uploaded\" files are identical (in bytes) to the files provided to `UpChunk`. Also, even though the API has only been changed in an additive way (e.g. adding `off()` and `once()` methods) and should be fully backwards compatible, this will likely be released as a major version change, due to the scope of the refactor.\r\n\r\nresolves: #89\r\n",
