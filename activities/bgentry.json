It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.  (Of course, looking out for minimums and maximums.)  ",

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.  (Of course, looking out for minimums and maximums.)  ",

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.  (Of course, looking out for minimums and maximums.)  ",

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.  (Of course, looking out for minimums and maximums.)  ",

It starts off using the chunk size defined by `chunkSize`, and if that chunk takes less than 10 seconds, it doubles the size.  If a chunk takes more than 30 seconds, it halves the chunk size.
