The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime.\n+\n+**Note**: This is _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.\n+\n+### `JsFunction::this`\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918\n+\n+`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.\n+\n+### Added Feature flag for external buffers\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937\n+\n+Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.\n+\n+## Improvements\n+\n+* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)\n+* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+\n+## Bug Fixes\n+\n+* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)\n+* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to reduce the likelihood of undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)\n+\n+## Docs\n+\n+* Significantly improved documentation of `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+* Removed unused values in `Channel` docs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+\n+### `cargo-cp-artifact`\n+\n+`0.1.7` includes a fix to unlink `.node` files before copying to reduce the chances of a code signing error on macOS (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/921).",

The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime.\n+\n+**Note**: This is _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.\n+\n+### `JsFunction::this`\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918\n+\n+`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.\n+\n+### Added Feature flag for external buffers\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937\n+\n+Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.\n+\n+## Improvements\n+\n+* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)\n+* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+\n+## Bug Fixes\n+\n+* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)\n+* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to reduce the likelihood of undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)",

As a workaround, I included a JavaScript snippet in the setup step that performs a manual expansion of the matrix.",

The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime.\n+\n+**Note**: This is _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.\n+\n+### `JsFunction::this`\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918\n+\n+`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.\n+\n+### Added Feature flag for external buffers\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937\n+\n+Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.\n+\n+## Improvements\n+\n+* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)\n+* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+\n+## Bug Fixes\n+\n+* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)\n+* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to reduce the likelihood of undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)\n+\n+## Docs\n+\n+* Significantly improved documentation of `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+* Removed unused values in `Channel` docs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+\n+### `cargo-cp-artifact`\n+\n+`0.1.7` includes a fix to unlink `.node` files before copying to reduce the chances of a code signing error on macOS (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/921).",

The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime.\n+\n+**Note**: This is _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.\n+\n+### `JsFunction::this`\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918\n+\n+`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.\n+\n+### Added Feature flag for external buffers\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937\n+\n+Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.\n+\n+## Improvements\n+\n+* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)\n+* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+\n+## Bug Fixes\n+\n+* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)\n+* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to reduce the likelihood of undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)",

As a workaround, I included a JavaScript snippet in the setup step that performs a manual expansion of the matrix.",

The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime.\n+\n+**Note**: This is _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.\n+\n+### `JsFunction::this`\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918\n+\n+`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.\n+\n+### Added Feature flag for external buffers\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937\n+\n+Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.\n+\n+## Improvements\n+\n+* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)\n+* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+\n+## Bug Fixes\n+\n+* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)\n+* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to reduce the likelihood of undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)\n+\n+## Docs\n+\n+* Significantly improved documentation of `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+* Removed unused values in `Channel` docs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+\n+### `cargo-cp-artifact`\n+\n+`0.1.7` includes a fix to unlink `.node` files before copying to reduce the chances of a code signing error on macOS (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/921).",

The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime.\n+\n+**Note**: This is _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.\n+\n+### `JsFunction::this`\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918\n+\n+`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.\n+\n+### Added Feature flag for external buffers\n+\n+https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937\n+\n+Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.\n+\n+## Improvements\n+\n+* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)\n+* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)\n+* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)\n+\n+## Bug Fixes\n+\n+* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)\n+* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to reduce the likelihood of undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)",

As a workaround, I included a JavaScript snippet in the setup step that performs a manual expansion of the matrix.",
