I am super pleased with PS.\r\n\r\nBut..   after update to r1605 it is no longer possible in my older Firefox (52.x) browser to upload files. And a new FF-version won't work on my XP (ancient but I want to hang to to that one as long as I can).\r\n\r\nThe upload.php page shows the info text about how to upload. \r\nAnd then it says:\r\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5, Flash or Silverlight. Please update your browser or install Adobe Flash or Silverlight to continue.\r\n\r\nBut that is not possible in the old Firefox 52.x\r\n\r\nTried with replacing the upload.php by the older one (r1295) but no use.\r\nAlso edit files (re-assign) is not possible as the form for selecting a client is missing.\r\n\r\nUsing PHP 8.0 as my host has changed his policy so returning to 7.4 and re-installing the old PS-version is not an option.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to work around that error? Or is there a fix?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nWerner\r\n",

I am super pleased with PS.\r\n\r\nBut..   after update to r1605 it is no longer possible in my older Firefox (52.x) browser to upload files. And a new FF-version won't work on my XP (ancient but I want to hang to to that one as long as I can).\r\n\r\nThe upload.php page shows the info text about how to upload. \r\nAnd then it says:\r\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5, Flash or Silverlight. Please update your browser or install Adobe Flash or Silverlight to continue.\r\n\r\nBut that is not possible in the old Firefox 52.x\r\n\r\nTried with replacing the upload.php by the older one (r1295) but no use.\r\nAlso edit files (re-assign) is not possible as the form for selecting a client is missing.\r\n\r\nUsing PHP 8.0 as my host has changed his policy so returning to 7.4 and re-installing the old PS-version is not an option.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to work around that error? Or is there a fix?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nWerner\r\n",

I am super pleased with PS.\r\n\r\nBut..   after update to r1605 it is no longer possible in my older Firefox (52.x) browser to upload files. And a new FF-version won't work on my XP (ancient but I want to hang to to that one as long as I can).\r\n\r\nThe upload.php page shows the info text about how to upload. \r\nAnd then it says:\r\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5, Flash or Silverlight. Please update your browser or install Adobe Flash or Silverlight to continue.\r\n\r\nBut that is not possible in the old Firefox 52.x\r\n\r\nTried with replacing the upload.php by the older one (r1295) but no use.\r\nAlso edit files (re-assign) is not possible as the form for selecting a client is missing.\r\n\r\nUsing PHP 8.0 as my host has changed his policy so returning to 7.4 and re-installing the old PS-version is not an option.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to work around that error? Or is there a fix?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nWerner\r\n",

I am super pleased with PS.\r\n\r\nBut..   after update to r1605 it is no longer possible in my older Firefox (52.x) browser to upload files. And a new FF-version won't work on my XP (ancient but I want to hang to to that one as long as I can).\r\n\r\nThe upload.php page shows the info text about how to upload. \r\nAnd then it says:\r\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5, Flash or Silverlight. Please update your browser or install Adobe Flash or Silverlight to continue.\r\n\r\nBut that is not possible in the old Firefox 52.x\r\n\r\nTried with replacing the upload.php by the older one (r1295) but no use.\r\nAlso edit files (re-assign) is not possible as the form for selecting a client is missing.\r\n\r\nUsing PHP 8.0 as my host has changed his policy so returning to 7.4 and re-installing the old PS-version is not an option.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to work around that error? Or is there a fix?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nWerner\r\n",

I am super pleased with PS.\r\n\r\nBut..   after update to r1605 it is no longer possible in my older Firefox (52.x) browser to upload files. And a new FF-version won't work on my XP (ancient but I want to hang to to that one as long as I can).\r\n\r\nThe upload.php page shows the info text about how to upload. \r\nAnd then it says:\r\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5, Flash or Silverlight. Please update your browser or install Adobe Flash or Silverlight to continue.\r\n\r\nBut that is not possible in the old Firefox 52.x\r\n\r\nTried with replacing the upload.php by the older one (r1295) but no use.\r\nAlso edit files (re-assign) is not possible as the form for selecting a client is missing.\r\n\r\nUsing PHP 8.0 as my host has changed his policy so returning to 7.4 and re-installing the old PS-version is not an option.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to work around that error? Or is there a fix?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nWerner\r\n",
