Maximum 20 teams will be awarded.)\r\n\r\n*All prizes will be paid out in FIL and outside of Gitcoin.\r\n\r\n**### Challenge Description**\r\n\r\nProjects that use [IPFS](http://docs.ipfs.io/) for content-addressing and/or [Filecoin](http://docs.filecoin.io/) for decentralized, persistent storage. (Submissions that use either technology indirectly via [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/), [Libp2p,](https://libp2p.io/) or other tooling also qualify). All types of projects are welcome and we welcome your creativity. Feel free to browse past winners [here](https://hackathons.filecoin.io/#hall-of-fame) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nAt a minimum submissions for prizes should include the following items:\r\n\r\n**1. Project Description**\r\n- The name and summary of the project\r\n- Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact info (e.g., GitHub handle, email address, or other)\r\n- How the project uses IPFS and/or Filecoin and/or decentralized storage services that build on top of either with example links to where in code those technologies are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Link to the publicly visible source code repository**\r\n- Provide comprehensive README, incl. a clear description of the work and mention of how our tech is used in the Technologies Used section of README.\r\n- Include a link to the working demo or provide a testing guide\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Showcase**\r\n- 2-3 minute video that presents the idea, including a brief demo that demonstrates the use of IPFS and/or Filecoin or anything that builds on top of them\r\n- If applicable, select the appropriate track when submitting the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nOnly submit what you have built specifically for this hackathon. Submitting a project previously submitted to any other of our hackathons will lead to disqualification\r\nOnly projects or features (preferably in separate branch) built specifically for the respective hackathon will be considered for prizes\r\nBroken links may disqualify the project from the judging process.\r\nUsing an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn\u2019t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nOur judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories: 1) Design, 2) Novelty/Originality, 3) Technical Accomplishment, 4) Potential Impact, 5) Creativity/Fun. Submissions will be rated with decimal numbers between 0 (worst) - 5 (best) per category (max score: 25). The final score is the average of all voting judges. If a project scores low, we reserve the right not to award prizes, even if it was the only project submitted to a given track.\r\n\r\n- \ud83e\udd29\u00a0**Novelty/Creativity:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way? Does it solve a new problem? Is it creative and puts a smile on people\u2019s faces?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83d\ude80 Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market? Is it\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\ude84\u00a0Filecoin & IPFS Implementation:** Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieving a CID from a gateway)? Does it use NFT.storage, web3.storage, or other storage helpers? Does it deploy a solidity smart contract to Filecoin Virtual Machine to compute over the stored data?\r\n\r\n- **\u2728Design:** How is the UX/UI/DX? Is it easy to use?

Grant owners - who want to get funds\r\n2. Grant contributors - who want to give their favorite projects funding\r\n3. (optionally) ecosystem builders - who want to support ecosystems of public goods\r\n\r\n<img width=\"624\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-04 at 7 47 45 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513929/199987950-4d4f28a7-7d0a-4b66-ae94-8efe896f9f8e.png\">\r\n\r\nThe application would need to have the following.\r\n1. Create Grant Flow\r\n2. Checkout Flow\r\n3. Add Matching Funds Flow\r\n4. Analytics Module to track contributions\r\n\r\nFrom a technology perspective, we are looking to build this \"right\".  That means good docs, good test coverage, responsive design, maintainable codebase, etc.  I've already validated the market for this with two throwaway builds ([1](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1291746535403741184), [2](https://twitter.com/_FundOSS/status/1410604319498407942)) and we want to invest in a solid codebase to host future web2 grants campaigns.\r\n\r\nIf you are a builder, please submit your application on the gitcoin bounty below.  I will select a builder (or team of builders) to build it in the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nI set the bounty to 10 ETH, but the actual compensation will probably be T&M as we kick off the project.\r\n",

Currently it is relatively easy to generate these two lists.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to check two things then:\r\n1. Is the license of my project compatible with that of the projects I'm reusing?\r\n2. Is the license of the project reusing my project compatible with my project's license?\r\n\r\nSo the idea is that when someone runs a check command, we get a warning if this is not the case. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can store the source data from this table: https://github.com/HansHammel/license-compatibility-checker/tree/f243eb4523ebc7d019a5928103e5b82b59b3b803 into our tool or otherwise collect data here: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/solution/joinup-licensing-assistant/jla-compatibility-checker\r\n\r\nAs our code will be doing hundreds of checks per minute, it's better that we natively store the license data and don't need an API for it.",

                "body": "### Prize Bounty\r\n\r\n$0.1627 RBTC (equivalent to 4000USD)\r\n\r\nAssigned reviewers: @Ashar2shahid, @camronh, @jgcogsystematictrading, @shenshin, and @bguiz\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\np2plnbot is a Telegram bot which allows people to trade with other people using telegram over the lightning network - [github.com/grunch/p2plnbot](https://github.com/grunch/p2plnbot).\r\n\r\nThe **base task**:\r\n\r\nFork the p2plnbot such that it works on RSK. This bot must be able to:\r\n- Enable peer-to-peer transfers between RSK network accounts of RBTC.\r\n- Enable peer-to-peer transfers between RSK network accounts of whitelisted ERC20 tokens. This whitelist must include RBTC and RIF.\r\n- (Optional) Enable transfers between RSK network accounts using RNS addresses (e.g. `*.rsk`), in addition to standard addresses (`0x\u2026`)\r\n\r\nThe **fair market price task**:\r\n\r\n- The bot currently requires the seller to manually input the price in a p2p trade\r\n- Instead of this, use price feeds from API3 to query the current price for the trade\r\n- Display this as \u201cfair market price\u201d within the bot, however the seller may still override it\r\n- The buyer should be able to see both the seller\u2019s price and the fair market price\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe **base task**:\r\n\r\n- The code must be publicly visible in a repo on github.com\r\n- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT\r\n- The submission must maintain the baseline functionality of, and support features of, the p2plnbot\r\n  - apart from switching from LN to RSK, if any features need to be removed, please clarify with the reviewers first.\r\n- The bot must have a live deployment, and the `@`-name of the bot must be included in the README within the repo\r\n- Record a video (screen capture) demonstrating the use of the Telegram bot\r\n- Any smart contracts used must be live on an RSK **public** network,\r\n  either RSK Testnet or RSK Mainnet; localhost and/or RSK Regtest is insufficient\r\n\r\nThe **fair market price task**:\r\n\r\n- The fair market price feature must make use of the price feeds from API3\r\n  - Trades occurring on this bot should use RSK Testnet or RSK Mainnet (your choice)\r\n  - Prices displayed in this feature of the bot should access the RBTC and RIF API3 price feeds available on RSK Mainnet only\r\n- API3 price feeds for RBTC and RIF on RSK Testnet are available using the following **Beacon IDs**:\r\n  - **RBTC/BTC**: `0x4aaf6e2ef7fc8280aa99d321e53ef2e4f111b7805677a262eb5882b1a27b5108`\r\n  - **RBTC/USD**: `0x5295f30436b2077a67c02001f62e8aabcc6688d87a8ce8db6f2b7a7cad4f0b01`\r\n  - **RIF/USD**: `0x3c7ba811cb33ad3784389a580af1a657ce0ebd701b1eb415eafabe5a4885e92f`\r\n- Other relevant smart contract addresses for API3 on RSK Testnet are:\r\n  - **DapiServer**: `0x3A09C138609F4b944EB7B8F0730e1972C243B33a`\r\n  - **selfServeDapiServerWhitelister**: `0x928922A4e2D3f96Ce72002A5EA7481BEF4F12fD6`\r\n- API3 price feed for RBTC and RIF are not available on RSK Mainnet for the purposes of this bounty.\r\n- To access prices feeds:\r\n  - Use the [API3 `readDataFeedWithId()` method](https://docs.api3.org/dapis/developers/read-data-feed-with-id.html).\r\n  - Use the [API3 `readDataFeedValueWithId()` method](https://docs.api3.org/dapis/developers/read-data-feed-value-with-id.html).\r\n  - For your convenience, a [demo repo is available](https://github.com/Ashar2shahid/data-feed-reader-example-rsk-testnet),\r\n    which demonstrates how to do this.\r\n\r\nDo you have questions, comments, or clarifications?\r\nReach out to the reviewers on the [RSK community slack: developers.rsk.co/slack](https://developers.rsk.co/slack) in the `#bounties` channel;\r\nand on the [API3 discord: discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W](https://discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W) in the `#dev-support` channel.\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n- This bounty starts on 15/08/2022\r\n- This bounty accepts submissions until 15/09/2022\r\n",

If you're not familiar with this concept - there is a [dedicated page about that](https://wtfisqf.com/)\r\n\r\nWe at Everscale, have the [Ever DAO](https://everdao.net) tool for decision-making. For the distribution itself, we still use a simple multi-signature smart contract, which seems to be a limited solution, causing coordination overheads and raising the collusion issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Gitcoin DAO, there is a Grants platform, which solves these issues. It became a leading public funding tool for web3. Gitcoin DAO employs the Quadratic Funding mechanism for years to fund open-source projects.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to build a dApp that will implement the project matching and public funds distribution protocol based on individual token contributions. \r\n\r\nNote: the Sybil Resistance issue is out of the scope of this bounty, but we highly encourage you to elaborate on that topic\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Resources \r\n\r\nThe [Ever DAO](https://everdao.net) is a simple proposal/voting smart contract system, which is capable to execute custom logic upon a successful vote. The [OctusBridge](https://octusbridge.io) DAO uses the same contracts to operate the OctusBridge configurations and manage its treasury.\r\n\r\nSee how [Ever DAO (OctusBridge DAO) contracts](https://github.com/broxus/octusbridge-contracts) are implemented and [connected to the web-based dApp](https://github.com/broxus/octusbridge-frontend)",

A highly composable system provides recombinant components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.\r\n\r\nComposability means that elements can be put together in a variety of ways, and still work. It gives the creator flexibility to create something that operates in a new way or a new order. \r\n\r\n## Examples of composable building blocks in the Everscale ecosystem\r\n\r\n* [DexPair](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/DexPair.sol) and [StablePair](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/DexAccount.sol)\r\n* [Token Factory](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/TokenFactory.sol)\r\n* FlatQube Dex [DAO & Farming Contracts](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-dao-contracts)\r\n\r\nIn this bounty, we invite you to build a smart contract system that executes a pipeline of simple interactions with existing building blocks. As an example, below we provide a list of ideas that can use a [FlatQube](https://flatqube.io) DEX smart contracts as building blocks. \r\n\r\nNote, that you can pick any products from the Everscale ecosystem as building blocks. We suggest you build around DEX because it's the easiest way to create something actually helpful. \r\n\r\nThe quality of smart contracts would be the main judging criterion for this bounty. However, we encourage you to build at least a simple frontend dApp for the demo.\r\n\r\n# Ideas\r\n\r\n### Strategy builder\r\nCreate a \"Strategy builder\" dApp, which allows users to configure and deploy a smart contract. The app should allow the execution of the following pipelines. \r\n\r\n- receive token + swap a preconfigured portion of them + optionally send to preconfigured recipient address\r\n- receive token + swap to multiple tokens according to configuration + rebalancing logic + withdraw method\r\n- receive token + swap in 50/50 proportion + provide liquidity to pool + receive LP + lock LP into farming pool + claim rewards method with optional recipient address\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to connect one pipeline to another.\r\n\r\n### Gasless wallet\r\n- Wallet with logic for maintaining preconfigured gas balance\r\n- Each transfer implicitly triggers an additional transfer of tokens to the Gas Giver contract \r\n- The Gas Giver contract should periodically swap collected tokens to EVERs to maintain its balance\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a GitHub repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo, and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made.  \r\n\r\nThe project **submission deadline is Nov 28th**.\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\n\r\n* IMPACT & USEFULNESS: How impactful and useful the submission is in the Everscale ecosystem as a whole \r\n* ORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION: How new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies \r\n* MASS USABILITY: How feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations \r\n* TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY: What is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission \r\n* CLARITY: How clear or easily understood the documentation, examples, and pitch video is \r\n* TEAM DIVERSITY: How diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nDecember, the 7th, 2022\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [FlatQube DEX](https://flatqube.io) ([contracts source code](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts))\r\n- [Yield optimizer around FlatQube farm pools](https://github.com/Black-INK-finance/contracts)\r\n- [Tutorial for advanced onchain token management](https://tip3-onboarding.gitbook.io/)\r\n\r\n## Join the Everscale Dev Community\r\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/everscale)\r\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/EverscaleSmartContracts)\r\n\r\n## Onboarding samples and stuff\r\n\r\n#### Everscale general concepts\r\n* [Terminology](https://docs.everscale.network/learn/terminology)\r\n* [Architecture](https://docs.everscale.network/arch)\r\n\r\n#### Solidity\r\nEverscale Solidity compiler implementation is a bit different from the original EVM compiler.\r\n\r\n* [Everscale Solidity data structures, instructions, and keywords (full reference)](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler/blob/master/API.md)\r\n* [Framework for setting up smart-contract development environment](https://github.com/broxus/locklift)\r\n\r\n#### FT\r\n\r\n* Reference implementation: https://github.com/broxus/tip3\r\n* Standard: https://docs.everscale.network/standard/TIP-3.2\r\n",

The exact amount of each bounty for utilities will be decided at the discretion of the Ylide core team.\r\n\r\nAll prizes can be paid in native EVER tokens, as well as in WEVER (ERC20) on Binance, Polygon, or Ethereum. \r\n\r\n# Challenge description\r\nWe have allocated an additional prize pool for useful mini-products and utilities that can be embedded into other projects of the Ylide ecosystem. We do not limit your creativity but list some ideas below\r\n\r\n# Ideas\r\n* **List of all token holders registered in Ylide**: service, that generates the list of addresses registered in Ylide Registry smart contracts by particular token (fungible or non-fungible).\r\n* **Server-side-messaging**: make a backend micro-project that can send messages via Ylide (Everscale and Ethereum). The changes that need to be made to the SDK can be published directly as pull requests on Ylide Github.\r\n* **Event as a format:** create the \u201cevent\u201d message format - it should be displayed in the mailbox in a special way (name, date, time, participants), and the recipient can add it to the calendar (via .ics, for example).\r\n* **Fancy QR-code generator for Ylide Mail:** make a cute QR-code business card generator ([example card](https://knowtechie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/knowtechie-instagram-qr-code.jpg)) but with the Ylide address. When it is scanned the Ylide Mail is opened with an option to add the respective address to the contacts list or compose a mail directly (you need a mini-tool to generate a nice QR + pull request additional functionality in our mailbox repo).\r\n* **Ylide browser extension:** make a browser extension that draws the \"Write to Ylide\" icon next to all Everscale/Ethereum addresses (provided that the address is registered in Ylide)\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a GitHub repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo, a link to the live dApp (if any), and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on the progress made.\r\n\r\nThe project\u00a0**submission deadline is Nov 28th.**\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\n* **Potential Impact:** How big of an impact could the project have?\r\n* **User Experience & Design:** Does the design of the project make the user experience easy?\r\n* **Implementation of the idea:** Does the end result demonstrate quality software development and design?\r\n* **Usage of Ylide\u2019s tools:** To what extent are the available standards and tools of Ylide leveraged?\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nWe will review all submissions very quickly after the end of the hackathon (23:59 UTC 28 Nov) and announce the winners along with the other track owners.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n* [Ylide Website](https://ylide.io/)\r\n* [Qamon Website](https://qamon.io/)\r\n* [Docs](https://docs.ylide.io/)\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/ylide-io)\r\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/XfKfKhbvHS)\r\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/ylide_chat)\r\n* [Telegram DM](https://t.me/ignat_ylide)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Sales data show that these in-game stats dominate above all else when it comes to valuing a pirate, with combat and constitution being the two most important stats. PIRATEs have been sold anywhere from 1-1,000 Algo. With over 15,000 PIRATEs in circulation and hundreds of pirates listed and sold it can be difficult for buyers and sellers, especially newcomers, to know what the fair value of a pirate is. We need a similarity service that accepts a single NFT and returns similar NFTs that have been recently valued by others (active listings or recent sales) based on weighted property data.\r\nThe service has several interesting challenges:\r\n* Pirates always change Pirate stats go up and down as pirates level-up, fight, die, and are revived. Keeping track of changing pirate data is important. New pirates are also minted daily so it\u2019s an ever evolving dataset. Some NFT collections don\u2019t change but we expect lots of gaming NFTs and future ARC19 NFTs to have high mutability.\r\n* Tracking current listings and sales - Data is all available via web3 to do it from the blockchain or you can use provided web2 APIs to get this data (see resources section for details).\r\n* Listings vs Sales - A similar pirate that Active listings and sales can both be used for finding similarities. For example the service can find: this NFT is similar to NFT \u201cA\u201d that was sold ~3 days ago for X Algo, and is also similar to NFT \u201cB\u201d that is currently listed for Y Algo.\r\n* Weighted Property Data - How does the service decide which properties are most meaningful? You can come up with your own heuristic or you could analyze bulk sales data to try and compute weights.\r\n\r\nAll of the data needed for this challenge re tracking NFTs, listings, and sales is available via web3 or one can use the AlgoSeas APIs to get this data (see Resources section for details) \r\n\r\nThe challenge is open-ended but the service should effectively answer this question: \u201cGiven an NFT what are the closest N active listings and what are the closest N recent sales for this NFT?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt minimum the response needs to contain the asset IDs that are most similar but it could also provide other data like the algo amount, date it occurred, whether it is a listing or a sale, a \u201csimilarity score\u201d (how close your service thinks these two NFTs are to each other), etc.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, and a recorded demo, working CLI, or live API that can be called (for determining the latency criteria).\r\nWe prefer the service to be written in TypeScript but will accept solutions in JavaScript or Python. This service will be folded into the AlgoSeas platform and maintained by the development team. We do not expect any frontend development for the challenge but if you want to build anything for demo purposes and to be usable by the team we prefer React.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made\r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a community vote that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November The community vote will primarily be for voting on NFT similarity and will be hosted in the AlgoSeas Discord.\r\nTwo representatives from AlgoSeas and two other judges (by invitation) will also assess each project submission by  17:00 EST on Monday the 14th of November. The following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\n#### FUNCTIONAL\r\nDoes it work when run against any pirate AssetID? Are the similar results provided reasonable? How do your results for a specific assetID compare to those of other submissions? Does it work when Pirate metadata is updated or when new Pirates are minted?\r\n#### LATENCY\r\nHow long does it take to get results from your service? Latency will be determined by running a series of requests and taking the p90 latency.\r\n#### EXTENSIBILITY\r\nHow generic is your solution, could it be easily applied to other NFT collections? Some examples of collections that it can be applied to include \u201cAlvatars: Tile Fighters\u201d or Alchemon.\r\n#### WOW FACTOR\r\nHackers always do surprising things. Thought of something that would be really cool to have that isn\u2019t listed here? Go for it and you can earn bonus points from this category!\r\n### Terms\r\nAll submitted code will be considered usable by the AlgoSeas team, regardless of whether or not the participants are chosen to receive a prize bounty. Additionally, refer to the Participation Agreement for full details.\r\nWinner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter. Ecosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\nResources\r\nAlgoSeas IndexerAPI - https://algoexplorer.io/api-dev/indexer-v2\r\nAlgoSeas Discord - https://discord.gg/HKQAGXKJc3\r\nAlgoSeas Discord Sales Channel - https://discord.gg/pf898W2U2j\r\n[Pirate NFT Creator address (NEX7N2...)](https://algoexplorer.io/address/NEX7N2U36UHBTRHJA4T3WEOOGYMPXL56ICNO4CCJAJBYFJSA7PZJU33H7U)\r\n[AlgoSeas Marketplace address (7SSZH\u2026)](https://algoexplorer.io/address/7SSZHWXNWMY3AV6HV5PTF3R2BPH67BMQPCCXWYQWUPHUKE6E4PA5QUOQSU)\r\nhttps://algoseas.io/marketplace\r\nhttps://algoseas.io/marketplace/collection/AlgoSeas%20Pirates \r\n#### GET Active Pirate Listings API\r\n[https://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/listings?type=listing&sortBy=price&sortAscending=true&collectionName=AlgoSeas Pirates&limit=500](https://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/listings?type=listing&sortBy=price&sortAscending=true&collectionName=AlgoSeas) \r\n#### GET Recent Pirate Sales API\r\nhttps://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/sales?collectionName=AlgoSeas%20Pirates&sortBy=time&sortAscending=false&limit=500\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate",

Except our Next.ID's DID bindings, we are also fetching the identity relation from different data sources like `rss3`, `keybase` and `knn3`. \r\n\r\n`relation_server` fetch data from [Upstream](https://docs.next.id/relation-service/rs-intro#upstreams)s\r\nWhen performing a data fetching process, RelationService will\r\n\r\n- Iter all available upstreams which can handle this query\r\n- Request and collect results from each upstream available\r\n- Newly fetched data will be fed into this circulation again, until no new data is yield.\r\n\r\nTo better understand how it will be processed, you could also check [Web5.bio](https://twitter.com/HominLuo/status/1574448473637724161). We are aiming to bring the identity graph to the social graph next year. To better support this goal, we need more data sources to be available in `relation_server`. \r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- Understand how does [GraphQL](https://docs.next.id/relation-service/rs-graphql) work. We need you to clean up and match the data structure we currently supported. About how does `relation_server` currently run, the actual code can be found at [src/upstream/mod.rs](https://github.com/nextdotid/relation_server/blob/develop/src/upstream/mod.rs) -> pub async fn fetch_all() definition. \r\n- The new data source you want to work on should not be our current-supported one. \r\n[ProofService](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-intro)\r\n[Keybase](https://keybase.io/)\r\n[SybilList](https://github.com/Uniswap/sybil-list/blob/master/verified.json)\r\n[RSS3](https://rss3.io/network/api.html)\r\n[KNN3](https://docs.knn3.xyz/graphql)\r\n[CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.me/)\r\nETH Leaderboard\r\nTheGraph for\r\n[ENS](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ensdomains/ens)\r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $2000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) before starting your hacking.

For now, `proof_server` performs `proof_post` fetching by API or single HTTP GET. \r\n\r\n`proof_server` is designed to prove \"An [Identity](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-identity) and an [Avatar](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-avatar) is held by the same person\".\r\n\r\nLet's take this assertion into 2 parts:\r\n\r\n\"I\" hold this Avatar.\r\n\"I\" hold this identity.\r\n1 equals \"Generate a signature using secret key of this Avatar\".\r\n\r\n2 equals \"Make an action using this identity\".\r\n\r\nHere we reach 1 and 2 with [Proof Post](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-proof-post) mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo make `proof_server` supports more and more services, we want our community endorsers to help us bring platforms like `facebook`, `xbox`, `instagram` etc. to be available on `proof_server`. \r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- The new platform should be able to let users themselves to using `proof_post` prove their identity. \r\n- The new platform should be a new platform that `proof_server` is not available now. Please check our current supported [Platform List](https://docs.next.id/rest-api/platforms). \r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $1000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) to understand our mechanism before starting your hacking. You will need to **create a pr** to this repo to submit your work.\r\n\r\n## Contact Info\r\n\r\n@hominluo @nykma here or Telegram for any question regarding how to work on Next.ID.",

But in real world, there may be no way for some `platform`s to do this way. Including:\r\n\r\n- No APIs at all provided by `platform`\r\n- API needs each user to do an `OAuth` to fetch their own data\r\n- API has very strict quota and will finally exceed if `proof_service` users grows.\r\n- User data cannot be fetched by single `HTTP GET` (e.g. JavaScript-driven `XHR` is performed in that page)\r\n- HTML DOM struct is changed frequently, can't define a fixed selector to query the data from DOM tree.\r\n- Remote HTTP server has a strict anti-bot mechanism, single `HTTP GET` will be blocked in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nTo make `proof_server` supports more and more services later, we need a headless browser to simulate normal user's page-browsing flow.\r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- The headless browser module can be kind of independent from current `proof_server`'s code structure. With a simple wrapper, `proof_server` can communicate with it in different processes.\r\n- The headless browser module will find user's proof post using single `regexp`, instead of parsing and `css-style` selecting DOM.\r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $3000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) before starting your hacking.

In web 2 we have established patterns for event architecture and publisher / subscriber model. For example all the consumers can listen to a source of an event and all the subscribers are notified when a certain even happens. In case of Algorand Blockchain, we have to poll the explorer to get status of events for example whether the transaction has been confirmed on chain, is the atomic swap has been completed or not. All the applications having this use case  are writing their own logic for popping the blockchain. We are looking to build a solution that will enable subscribing to events on the blockchain and all the subscribers will be notified in real time of the various events they subscribe to.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. \r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a quadratic community voting element to the judging process that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November. \r\nFour judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by Monday the 14th of November. \r\n\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\nIMPACT & USEFULNESS:\r\nHow impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole\r\nORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION:\r\nHow new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies\r\nMASS USABILITY:\r\nHow feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations\r\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:\r\nWhat is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission\r\nCLARITY:\r\nHow clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is\r\nTEAM DIVERSITY:\r\nHow diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.\r\nEcosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\n### Resources\r\nDeveloper.algorand.org\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/\r\nhttps://github.com/algorand-devrel\r\nAlgorand Discord - https://discord.gg/Algorand\r\n\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate\r\n",

Content, products, and data will be created and owned by users.\r\n\r\nThis challenge is to explore connecting GameFi to the real world's productivity. How does GameFi incentivize its creators? How does GameFi combine the sales and application of robo-vehicle in the real world? How to combine it with the governance of a DAO? Most importantly, this challenge should avoid taking the game out of its essence and becoming a Ponzi scheme.\r\n\r\nPlease facilitate participants in the Game Design Planning challenge to elaborate on why this game could bring great fun to its players and connect to the real world's productivity.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission needs to include the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u25cf Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.  \r\n\u25cf Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.  \r\n\u25cf Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.  \r\n\u25cf You can continue to optimize your proposal by getting feedback from other participants/challenges.  \r\n\u25cf The final submission is one PDF format document (1920 \u00d7 1080p, 16:9) with some infographics. We only accept the original projects, it cannot be anything you have done before this Hackathon.  \r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nPanel assessment on the project's innovation and feasibility.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nNov 7th\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nKeep up with announcements about this challenge \ud83d\udc49[Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/Ge3U7BfjxC)  \r\nCheck the Game Design Planning challenge\u2019s output \ud83d\udc49 [Issue 1](https://github.com/DeAutoDAO/Hackathon_-I-Game-Robot/issues/1)  \r\nMeet other participants \ud83d\udc49 [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/CHdW29G3Ee)  \r\nRead this article to understand why and how to achieve democratic innovation of robo-vehicle manufacturing \ud83d\udc49[Medium](https://medium.com/@nancylee007)  \r\nKnow more about DeAuto\u2019s ultimate vision \ud83d\udc49 [Official Website](https://www.deauto.io/)  ",

Maximum 20 teams will be awarded.)\r\n\r\n*All prizes will be paid out in FIL and outside of Gitcoin.\r\n\r\n**### Challenge Description**\r\n\r\nProjects that use [IPFS](http://docs.ipfs.io/) for content-addressing and/or [Filecoin](http://docs.filecoin.io/) for decentralized, persistent storage. (Submissions that use either technology indirectly via [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/), [Libp2p,](https://libp2p.io/) or other tooling also qualify). All types of projects are welcome and we welcome your creativity. Feel free to browse past winners [here](https://hackathons.filecoin.io/#hall-of-fame) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nAt a minimum submissions for prizes should include the following items:\r\n\r\n**1. Project Description**\r\n- The name and summary of the project\r\n- Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact info (e.g., GitHub handle, email address, or other)\r\n- How the project uses IPFS and/or Filecoin and/or decentralized storage services that build on top of either with example links to where in code those technologies are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Link to the publicly visible source code repository**\r\n- Provide comprehensive README, incl. a clear description of the work and mention of how our tech is used in the Technologies Used section of README.\r\n- Include a link to the working demo or provide a testing guide\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Showcase**\r\n- 2-3 minute video that presents the idea, including a brief demo that demonstrates the use of IPFS and/or Filecoin or anything that builds on top of them\r\n- If applicable, select the appropriate track when submitting the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nOnly submit what you have built specifically for this hackathon. Submitting a project previously submitted to any other of our hackathons will lead to disqualification\r\nOnly projects or features (preferably in separate branch) built specifically for the respective hackathon will be considered for prizes\r\nBroken links may disqualify the project from the judging process.\r\nUsing an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn\u2019t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nOur judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories: 1) Design, 2) Novelty/Originality, 3) Technical Accomplishment, 4) Potential Impact, 5) Creativity/Fun. Submissions will be rated with decimal numbers between 0 (worst) - 5 (best) per category (max score: 25). The final score is the average of all voting judges. If a project scores low, we reserve the right not to award prizes, even if it was the only project submitted to a given track.\r\n\r\n- \ud83e\udd29\u00a0**Novelty/Creativity:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way? Does it solve a new problem? Is it creative and puts a smile on people\u2019s faces?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83d\ude80 Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market? Is it\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\ude84\u00a0Filecoin & IPFS Implementation:** Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieving a CID from a gateway)? Does it use NFT.storage, web3.storage, or other storage helpers? Does it deploy a solidity smart contract to Filecoin Virtual Machine to compute over the stored data?\r\n\r\n- **\u2728Design:** How is the UX/UI/DX? Is it easy to use? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive? Does the visual design delight you?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny winners will be notified after the event is over with specific instructions (including but not limited to filling out the necessary tax information) on how to claim their prize. Failure to provide the appropriate information within the timeframe specified in the winner notification message could mean delayed payment or claim rejection.\r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nWinners will be announced after the end of the 2022 Gitcoin Social Hour.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [Additional information on eligibility criteria](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82)\r\n- [Getting Started with IPFS & Filecoin](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Getting-Started-With-IPFS-Filecoin-c00526cf97ba4087ba5c3ad5f5337a58)\r\n- [IPFS & Filecoin Discord](https://discord.gg/Ymp3XZPH9V)\r\n- [Community Office Hours](https://bitly.protocol.ai/Community-Office-Hours)\r\n- [30-minute introduction on how to build with IPFS & Filecoin](https://youtu.be/5-0_DqXGY-M)",

This change would allow us to build another apps with exactly the same indexing functionality as in Navigator and also to improve it for all apps at the same time.\r\n\r\nRoom DB must be used only for keeping list of folders after solving this task. Index will be kept in memory of `arklib` process. We should guarantee that `arklib` is not killed as long as app instance lives. Even better if we can keep it live longer than the app, so if we restarted the app we would not recalculate the index. If this is not possible, we will need to create persistence of index (cache), see https://github.com/ARK-Builders/ARK-Navigator/issues/142 and https://github.com/ARK-Builders/arklib/issues/15 for more details.",

The decentralized app should reward existing customers with an application token when a specific action is taken or some time in membership has elapsed. The exact conditions are not specified but could be for recruiting new members to an organization, a website, or discord channel. Members may be rewarded for performing specific operations like answering questions for new users or being in an organization for a certain length of time. The application should support adding or modifying reward conditions and amounts. These conditions should be implemented in smart contracts and triggered by using one of the Algorand SDKs. The loyalty token should be redeemable for additional member benefits like additional privileges or exchangeable for merchandise at a given level. \r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. \r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a quadratic community voting element to the judging process that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November. \r\nFour judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by Monday the 14th of November. \r\n\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\nIMPACT & USEFULNESS:\r\nHow impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole\r\nORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION:\r\nHow new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies\r\nMASS USABILITY:\r\nHow feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations\r\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:\r\nWhat is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission\r\nCLARITY:\r\nHow clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is\r\nTEAM DIVERSITY:\r\nHow diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.\r\nEcosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\n### Resources\r\nDeveloper.algorand.org\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/\r\nhttps://github.com/algorand-devrel\r\nAlgorand Discord - https://discord.gg/Algorand\r\n\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate\r\n",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "## Description\r\nCreate an Agoric governance component using a new ElectionType that instantiates a public vote to give voting facets to the election winners. There should be a public registration of the identities of the candidates to make them visible.\r\n\r\nThis bounty focuses on creating the committee that will be elected and includes a charter to control the manner of their election and operation. Our existing committee is elected only once, and the membership can't be updated. The biggest open issues are refreshing the membership, and controlling the ability to create new votes.\r\n\r\nPossible approaches to membership include replacing members who have become unresponsive, scheduling periodic elections, or supporting recalls. There are several plausible ways to limit the ability to open new questions: a chair or subcommittee, require approval from some subset of the members, or requiring a payment or deposit.\r\n\r\nThis bounty shouldn't include any work on those who vote to elect this committee. Internally, those processes are currently under review.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nCurrently, voters only get a voting facet via an invitation. The electors vote to choose a committee, and the committee members then get the ability to vote. The voters can reliably identify the Electorate by subscribing to get a list of new questions. Voters can use the questionHandle from each update from the subscription to get the questionDetails. They cast their vote by sending their selected position(s) to their electorate, which they know and trust.\r\n\r\nWe want everyone to be able to identify the candidates and winners. Anyone who knows the electorate can get a list of questions, so this includes both the original electorate and the elected committee members for the original election, and then the committee itself will be well-known, and so both the public and the committee members can find out what questions the committee is voting on.\r\n\r\nThis structure of Electorates and VoteCounters allows voters and observers to verify how votes will be counted, and who can vote on them, but doesn't constrain the process of creating questions. We now have a PSMCharter and EconCommittee Charter, that control aspects of creating questions that those committees can vote on. A charter or electionManager can control the voting threshold, the vote closing time, or the range of parameter values that can be specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nA successful bounty will:\r\n* Complete the requirements from the description including reasonable edge cases not explicitly defined\r\n* Pass code review from Agoric team\r\n* Include documented open source code and walkthrough presentation\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\nAbout One Week\r\n\r\n## Reward\r\n$3200\r\n\r\nPayment will be made in USD (fiat currency) via wire transfer. The developer is responsible for providing their completed tax documents (W9 for US based developers and/or W8 or W8-BEN-E for non-US based developers) and providing their banking details in order to receive payment. \r\n\r\n## Applicant Assessment Criteria\r\nImportant: Please provide a clear work plan for how you will approach this bounty.  Use the work plan as an initial demonstration that you would be a good candidate.  Bounties will require coordination with the Agoric team, so unfortunately only plans submitted in English will be considered.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n* Issue-specific domain experience\r\n* Issue-specific technical capability\r\n* Familiarity with Agoric's platform\r\n* JavaScript experience\r\n* Availability and communication\r\n\r\n## Experience Write-up (1000-1500 words)\r\nAs part of completing the bounty, we ask that you write up a short summary of your experience building on Agoric. Write-up should include:\r\n* Begin with a compelling, relevant introductory hook statement (<50 words). \r\n* Clearly explain the specific bounty project (~100 words). \r\n* Describe how the developer approached the problem (~300 words). \r\n* Give a step-by-step description of the solution (>500 words && <1000 words).\r\n* At least three code snippets per write-up. They do not count toward overall word count. \r\n* Conclude with clear calls to action on developing with Agoric - specifically how any ambition developer reading this piece could do more themselves (>150 words). \r\n\r\nThis is important feedback for us as we evolve the platform.\r\n\r\n## Review Process\r\n* Agoric team reviews your submitted work plan on Gitcoin.\r\n* It is best to join our Discord and post your Gitcoin name in the bounties channel, so that we can follow up with you. Otherwise, we will write on your Gitcoin profile wall and say hello!\r\n* Agoric contacts you to provide reference projects / sample code for engineering review.\r\n* Introductory call to discuss your plans and expected timeline.\r\n* Join the Agoric Discord bounties channel (if you haven\u2019t done so already).\r\n* Agoric accepts you on Gitcoin and you get started!\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Agoric Documentation](https://docs.agoric.com/)\r\n* [Agoric Governance Doc](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/governance)\r\n* [#bounties channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/854426485900967988) for general questions and your private bounty channel for direct questions to the Agoric team",

Fairdrive, a personal data store, is looking to support such a dApp which would allow its users to access their stored data to generate NFTs. Leveraging the provided library, the goal is to correctly connect the metadata of the content and the image.\r\n\r\nAs a User, I would like an NFT Generator dApp connected to Fairdrive that allows me to select an image and mint as NFT in xDai saved to Swarm, so that I can expand on the value of my data stored in Fairdrive. \r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n\r\n- Familiarize with the repo containing Fairdrive: https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp\r\n- Familiarize yourself with the SwarmNFT.js: https://github.com/igar1991/SwarmNFT\r\n- Create Repo on Github that contains code\r\n- Create Generator dApp that follows the process below:\r\n    - Open the NFT Generator dApp\r\n    - Connect to Fairdrive\r\n    - Select a folder of images in Fairdrive\r\n    - Select a specific a specific image\r\n    - Use selected image to Generate an NFT\r\n    - NFT to be minted on xDai\r\n    - Newly minted NFT to be stored to Swarm\r\n\r\n\r\n**Approving criteria**\r\n\r\n- A new public repo is opened with open source code and a link to the repo is in the Gitcoin issue. \r\n- Include Readme file with instructions on how to use the app\r\n- Use open source license Apache 2.0\r\n- User's have the ability to open an NFT Generator, connected to Fairdrive that allows them to select an image to mint as NFT in xDai saved to Swarm.\r\n-\r\n\r\n**Timeline**\r\n\r\n- Due 15th Feb 2022\r\n\r\nUse the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KrVTmahcUA) for more information and support.\r\n\r\nMind the [Fair Data Society Principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/) in your tasks.",

It enables us to more easily navigate the world around us and find places of interest.\r\n- Maintaining relevant maps on a global scale is a massive effort that just a few (commercial) providers are able to tackle to an appropriate degree - thereby only a couple of large players are present. Providing maps and services on top of them gives them a competitive edge and certain power over the market of all the services connected to them.\r\n- Project Galileo builds on top of FairOS which uses Swarm\u2019s decentralized storage. It is tackling two aspects that are crucial to solving the above problems: how can decentralized storage and tech be used to host the geodata and how can communities be engaged to contribute and be properly compensated for the contributions.\r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n- Familiarize with the repo containing Galileo : https://github.com/fairDataSociety/galileo\r\n- Familiarize yourself with the rendered content on the Galileo webpage: https://app.galileo.fairdatasociety.org/  \r\n- Follow the instructions in the Galileo repo (https://github.com/fairDataSociety/galileo#readme ) on \"How to create and share your own map?\"\r\n- Use the instructions to contribute the **map of Kenya**; take notes where instructions might be improved   \r\n\r\n**Approving criteria**\r\n- Map of **Kenya** is visible on the Galileo webpage\r\n- Feedback on instructions is given, with possible improvements noted (something between 250 -500 words)\r\n\r\n**Timeline**\r\n- Deadline: 15th Feb 2022\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n[Swarm documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/).\r\n[FairOS documentation](https://docs.fairos.fairdatasociety.org/docs/).\r\nUse the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.gg/KrVTmahcUA) for more information and support.\r\nMind the [Fair Data Society Principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/) in your tasks.",

Then read on!\r\n\r\n**Want to create a product on the platform? Here\u2019s some things to think about:**\r\n\r\nAt Reserve, we see our new protocol as a platform for people to launch products and even businesses on. So go ahead, build and pitch your product idea. Come up with a clever, catchy brand. Figure out the economics for how this can be sustainable for this system, and maybe even for you as a builder. Build new collateral plugins or leverage existing one. Fork the [Register.app](https://register.app/) repo and create a custom website and interface to mint it, redeem it, and stake/unstake RSR.\r\n\r\nShould there be a flywheel that builds up treasury tokens for increased voting power in defi? Should it instead fund marketing operations? How much AUM and revenue is needed to do that?\r\n\r\nWhat is the \u201crisk / reward\u201d profile of this token? Is it high yield, high risk? Low yield, low risk? Something else? Do the collateral plugins exist? Do they need to be written?\r\n\r\nThis is for you to decide and invent. Feel free to leverage any and all content we\u2019ve created for inspiration or just use your team\u2019s own \ud83e\udde0.\r\n\r\n**Want to create a tool for the ecosystem? Here\u2019s some things to think about:**\r\n\r\nThere are two main constituents in our ecosystem: 1) governors / stakers and 2) RToken holders. These groups have some similar, but many different needs and potential pain points. \r\n\r\nThere are also other smaller but no less critical roles in the ecosystem: Gaurdians, Pausers, \u201ceconomic designers\u201d. Economic designers might need to know more than a typical yield-farmer: other risk factors, how those interplay and overlap with other types of collateral, etc. Pausers and Gaurdians need to be on-call with varying SLAs and be able to make fairly quick decisions based on data that is not at their fingertips.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\n- Links to implementation repositories (github, gitlab, etc). Include in that repository:\r\n    - Project description\r\n    - Links to live project, if applicable (recommended)\r\n- Demo Video\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria for your Creation\r\n\r\nOur single overriding criterion for judging submissions is the importance of your project to the overall Reserve ecosystem, as determined by the Reserve judges.\r\n\r\nThe bigger this thing could make the overall ecosystem, the more excited we will be about it. \u201cImportance\u201d is admittedly vague, but is composed mostly of the following subcriteria:\r\n\r\n- Completeness of project.\r\n- Anticipated usefulness of project (i.e. viability for a product).\r\n- Safety of project to all constituents.\r\n- Quality of project (code, design, economics).\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n>\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

If a similar tutorial or solution already exists on the Developer Portal, how is this different and important?\r\n- Relevance - Is the topic particularly relevant to the developer community given current market trends and community needs?\r\n- Complexity - How complex was the problem you were trying to solve? Was the solution to the complex problem simple and elegant?\r\n- Community Feedback - Is your topic supported and audited by the community? How many stars did the Github repo receive?\r\n- Utility/Value - How much value will this bring to the Algorand developer community? Does it help solve a problem that many developers have? Does it provide depth to a topic that doesn't yet exist for a certain domain?\r\n- Code Quality - Is the code and repository well-organized and documented? Does it adhere to language-specific style guidelines?\r\n- Writing Quality - Is the writing clear and informative for a developer audience? Is it free from grammar mistakes and typos?\r\n- Scope of Work - How much time and effort did it take to complete this project?\r\n- **Extra Media - Does the submission include images, screenshots, and/or videos?**\r\n\r\n# Submission Procedure\r\nSubmit your blog post following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Submit your completed Github Repository to Gitcoin\r\n2. Sign Up or Log In onto the Algorand Developer Portal.\r\n3. Create a new publication, of type \"Tutorial\" on the Algorand Developer Portal.\r\n4. Draft your publication and \"Submit for Review\".\r\n5. Provide your Gitcoin bounty project page link in the comment section of the submitted draft page. \r\n6. Work with the Dev Rel team to edit and finalize the submission.\r\n7. **For more synchronized communication, provide a discord username in the comment section.**\r\n\r\n# Other Requirements\r\n\r\n- For questions, reach out to Algorand on [Discord](https://discord.gg/84AActu3at).\r\n- Taking this bounty task means you have agreed to our Bounty Agreement terms and policies.\r\n- All project codes should be published on GitHub, with MIT license or Apache V2 license.\r\n- All contributions/PRs to public (Algorand) repositories should be open source and should follow the contributions rules of the relevant repository.\r\n- All non-codes documents should be using Markdown format.\r\n- In the project description or repository readme, there should be a proper security notice. E.g., it should tell the visitor the project is not audited and should not be used in a production environment.\r\n- You are not eligible to receive additional rewards through other Algorand programs like the developer ambassadors program.\r\n",

These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n** ### Acceptance Criteria **\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n> \r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/) + Intro Video\r\n- How the Protocol Works Video",

The prize bounty will be split amongst the top 3 submissions with 1st place receiving $3,500, 2nd place receiving $1,000, and 3rd place receiving $500.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\nThis is a special Devcon themed challenge to build the best air gapped wallet asset verification experience. We want everyone to benefit from a more streamlined and simplified wallet asset verification process where the assets that need to be verified can only be accessed on a separate \u201cair gapped\u201d system. Both systems can be connected to a network, but the incentive should capture the ability to verify any wallet owned assets where that wallet does not want to be exposed to a broader network.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this challenge is to simply verify an offline high value wallet asset with an online mobile wallet or device. For example, imagine that you want to verify a high value NFT that lives in your Ledger or Trezor wallet to gain entry to an exclusive event, you prove ownership of the asset but not be required to bring your hardware wallet to the event and be required to connect and sign a message in a crowded public space. How could you perform the same verification with your mobile phone that still allows the event to assert your ownership of the asset?\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nSubmissions must be a valid public GitHub repository containing the open source code for an air gapped wallet asset verification solution. All submissions must be received by October 28th, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThe prize pool will be split among valid submissions at the discretion of a panel of Shopify blockchain team judges. Scoring parameters include the UX, ingenuity/innovation, simplicity, and visual flair. There will be 10 points for UX, 5 each for all remaining parameters for a total of 25 points. \r\n\r\nYour submission must demonstrate the ability to verify one or more air gapped wallet assets such as NFTs and other tokens, as well as verify any quantities or attributes defined by those tokens.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be notified by November 4th, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST. Prize payouts will be completed by November 10, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST. \r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThis challenge is being sponsored by the blockchain team at Shopify. We want to engage the community and create a challenge opportunity for teams to create a fun and exciting product that will benefit the Ethereum community as a whole. The winners of the challenge will receive a monetary prize and the notoriety that comes with building something amazing that people want to use in their projects. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to blockchain-challenge@shopify.com or leave a comment on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Shopify/gitcoin-bounties/issues/1).\r\n",

                "body": "## Description\r\nCreate an Agoric governance component using a VoteCounter that correctly evaluates election results for [instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting). \r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThe only vote counter currently is the BinaryVoteCounter, which presumes there are two positions on the ballot and assigns every vote to one or the other or to 'spoiled'. At the end, it looks for a majority winner and announces that. It can be configured to have one of the possible outcomes as the default outcome. If there's a tie and no default, the winner is undefined.\r\n\r\nContractGovernance uses this to make 'no change' be the default when voting on parameter changes.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nA successful bounty will:\r\n* Complete the requirements from the description including reasonable edge cases not explicitly defined\r\n* Pass code review from Agoric team\r\n* Include documented open source code and walkthrough presentation\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\nOne Week\r\n\r\n## Reward\r\n$3,200\r\n\r\nPayment will be made in USD (fiat currency) via wire transfer. The developer is responsible for providing their completed tax documents (W9 for US based developers and/or W8 or W8-BEN-E for non-US based developers) and providing their banking details in order to receive payment. \r\n\r\n## Applicant Assessment Criteria\r\nImportant: Please provide a clear work plan for how you will approach this bounty.  Use the work plan as an initial demonstration that you would be a good candidate.  Bounties will require coordination with the Agoric team, so unfortunately only plans submitted in English will be considered.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n* Issue-specific domain experience\r\n* Issue-specific technical capability\r\n* Familiarity with Agoric's platform\r\n* JavaScript experience\r\n* Availability and communication\r\n\r\n## Experience Write-up (1000-1500 words)\r\nAs part of completing the bounty, we ask that you write up a short (or long!) summary of your experience building on Agoric. Write-up should:\r\n* Begin with a compelling, relevant introductory hook statement (<50 words). \r\n* Clearly explain the specific bounty project (~100 words). \r\n* Describe how the developer approached the problem (~300 words). \r\n* Give a step-by-step description of the solution (>500 words && <1000 words).\r\n* At least three code snippets per write-up. They do not count toward overall word count. \r\n* Conclude with clear calls to action on developing with Agoric - specifically how any ambition developer reading this piece could do more themselves (>150 words). \r\n\r\nThis is important feedback for us as we evolve the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Review Process\r\n* Agoric team reviews your submitted work plan on Gitcoin\r\n* It is best to join our Discord and post your gitcoin name in the bounties channel, so that we can follow up with you. Otherwise, we will write on your gitcoin profile wall and say hello!\r\n* Agoric contacts you to provide reference projects / sample code for engineering review\r\n* Introductory call to discuss your plans and expected timeline\r\n* You join the Agoric Discord bounties channel (if you haven\u2019t done so already) \r\n* Agoric accepts you on Gitcoin and you get started!\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Agoric Documentation](https://docs.agoric.com/)\r\n* [Agoric Governance Doc](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/governance)\r\n* [#bounties channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/854426485900967988) for general questions and your private bounty channel for direct questions to the Agoric team",

Maximum 20 teams will be awarded.)\r\n\r\n*All prizes will be paid out in FIL and outside of Gitcoin.\r\n\r\n**### Challenge Description**\r\n\r\nProjects that use [IPFS](http://docs.ipfs.io/) for content-addressing and/or [Filecoin](http://docs.filecoin.io/) for decentralized, persistent storage. (Submissions that use either technology indirectly via [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/), [Libp2p,](https://libp2p.io/) or other tooling also qualify). All types of projects are welcome and we welcome your creativity. Feel free to browse past winners [here](https://hackathons.filecoin.io/#hall-of-fame) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nAt a minimum submissions for prizes should include the following items:\r\n\r\n**1. Project Description**\r\n- The name and summary of the project\r\n- Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact info (e.g., GitHub handle, email address, or other)\r\n- How the project uses IPFS and/or Filecoin and/or decentralized storage services that build on top of either with example links to where in code those technologies are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Link to the publicly visible source code repository**\r\n- Provide comprehensive README, incl. a clear description of the work and mention of how our tech is used in the Technologies Used section of README.\r\n- Include a link to the working demo or provide a testing guide\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Showcase**\r\n- 2-3 minute video that presents the idea, including a brief demo that demonstrates the use of IPFS and/or Filecoin or anything that builds on top of them\r\n- If applicable, select the appropriate track when submitting the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nOnly submit what you have built specifically for this hackathon. Submitting a project previously submitted to any other of our hackathons will lead to disqualification\r\nOnly projects or features (preferably in separate branch) built specifically for the respective hackathon will be considered for prizes\r\nBroken links may disqualify the project from the judging process.\r\nUsing an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn\u2019t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nOur judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories: 1) Design, 2) Novelty/Originality, 3) Technical Accomplishment, 4) Potential Impact, 5) Creativity/Fun. Submissions will be rated with decimal numbers between 0 (worst) - 5 (best) per category (max score: 25). The final score is the average of all voting judges. If a project scores low, we reserve the right not to award prizes, even if it was the only project submitted to a given track.\r\n\r\n- \ud83e\udd29\u00a0**Novelty/Creativity:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way? Does it solve a new problem? Is it creative and puts a smile on people\u2019s faces?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83d\ude80 Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market? Is it\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\ude84\u00a0Filecoin & IPFS Implementation:** Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieving a CID from a gateway)? Does it use NFT.storage, web3.storage, or other storage helpers? Does it deploy a solidity smart contract to Filecoin Virtual Machine to compute over the stored data?\r\n\r\n- **\u2728Design:** How is the UX/UI/DX? Is it easy to use? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive? Does the visual design delight you?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny winners will be notified after the event is over with specific instructions (including but not limited to filling out the necessary tax information) on how to claim their prize. Failure to provide the appropriate information within the timeframe specified in the winner notification message could mean delayed payment or claim rejection.\r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nWinners will be announced after the end of the 2022 Gitcoin Social Hour.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [Additional information on eligibility criteria](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82)\r\n- [Getting Started with IPFS & Filecoin](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Getting-Started-With-IPFS-Filecoin-c00526cf97ba4087ba5c3ad5f5337a58)\r\n- [IPFS & Filecoin Discord](https://discord.gg/Ymp3XZPH9V)\r\n- [Community Office Hours](https://bitly.protocol.ai/Community-Office-Hours)\r\n- [30-minute introduction on how to build with IPFS & Filecoin](https://youtu.be/5-0_DqXGY-M)",

                "body": "I am looking to build a web2 Grants platform that simplifies the facilitation of funding public goods in local communities.\r\n\r\nHere is what Im thinking the architecture could look like:\r\n\r\nA platform that hosts grants, with a plugin architecture that allows various\r\n1. capital allocation plugins (eg quadratic funding, dominance assurance contracts, etc)\r\n2. checkout plugins\r\n\r\nThis platform would have easy ways to publishing to/subscribing from grants registries in the web3 ecosystem, allowing easy transferability of grants from each paradigm.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1237\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-04 at 7 44 36 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513929/199987268-871619c9-04a4-4fe6-82ab-c1c0864e2c00.png\">\r\n\r\nThe main \"customers\" for this platform would be \r\n1. Grant owners - who want to get funds\r\n2. Grant contributors - who want to give their favorite projects funding\r\n3. (optionally) ecosystem builders - who want to support ecosystems of public goods\r\n\r\n<img width=\"624\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-04 at 7 47 45 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513929/199987950-4d4f28a7-7d0a-4b66-ae94-8efe896f9f8e.png\">\r\n\r\nThe application would need to have the following.\r\n1. Create Grant Flow\r\n2. Checkout Flow\r\n3. Add Matching Funds Flow\r\n4. Analytics Module to track contributions\r\n\r\nFrom a technology perspective, we are looking to build this \"right\".  That means good docs, good test coverage, responsive design, maintainable codebase, etc.  I've already validated the market for this with two throwaway builds ([1](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1291746535403741184), [2](https://twitter.com/_FundOSS/status/1410604319498407942)) and we want to invest in a solid codebase to host future web2 grants campaigns.\r\n\r\nIf you are a builder, please submit your application on the gitcoin bounty below.  I will select a builder (or team of builders) to build it in the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nI set the bounty to 10 ETH, but the actual compensation will probably be T&M as we kick off the project.\r\n",

Currently it is relatively easy to generate these two lists.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to check two things then:\r\n1. Is the license of my project compatible with that of the projects I'm reusing?\r\n2. Is the license of the project reusing my project compatible with my project's license?\r\n\r\nSo the idea is that when someone runs a check command, we get a warning if this is not the case. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can store the source data from this table: https://github.com/HansHammel/license-compatibility-checker/tree/f243eb4523ebc7d019a5928103e5b82b59b3b803 into our tool or otherwise collect data here: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/solution/joinup-licensing-assistant/jla-compatibility-checker\r\n\r\nAs our code will be doing hundreds of checks per minute, it's better that we natively store the license data and don't need an API for it.",

This bot must be able to:\r\n- Enable peer-to-peer transfers between RSK network accounts of RBTC.\r\n- Enable peer-to-peer transfers between RSK network accounts of whitelisted ERC20 tokens. This whitelist must include RBTC and RIF.\r\n- (Optional) Enable transfers between RSK network accounts using RNS addresses (e.g. `*.rsk`), in addition to standard addresses (`0x\u2026`)\r\n\r\nThe **fair market price task**:\r\n\r\n- The bot currently requires the seller to manually input the price in a p2p trade\r\n- Instead of this, use price feeds from API3 to query the current price for the trade\r\n- Display this as \u201cfair market price\u201d within the bot, however the seller may still override it\r\n- The buyer should be able to see both the seller\u2019s price and the fair market price\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe **base task**:\r\n\r\n- The code must be publicly visible in a repo on github.com\r\n- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT\r\n- The submission must maintain the baseline functionality of, and support features of, the p2plnbot\r\n  - apart from switching from LN to RSK, if any features need to be removed, please clarify with the reviewers first.\r\n- The bot must have a live deployment, and the `@`-name of the bot must be included in the README within the repo\r\n- Record a video (screen capture) demonstrating the use of the Telegram bot\r\n- Any smart contracts used must be live on an RSK **public** network,\r\n  either RSK Testnet or RSK Mainnet; localhost and/or RSK Regtest is insufficient\r\n\r\nThe **fair market price task**:\r\n\r\n- The fair market price feature must make use of the price feeds from API3\r\n  - Trades occurring on this bot should use RSK Testnet or RSK Mainnet (your choice)\r\n  - Prices displayed in this feature of the bot should access the RBTC and RIF API3 price feeds available on RSK Mainnet only\r\n- API3 price feeds for RBTC and RIF on RSK Testnet are available using the following **Beacon IDs**:\r\n  - **RBTC/BTC**: `0x4aaf6e2ef7fc8280aa99d321e53ef2e4f111b7805677a262eb5882b1a27b5108`\r\n  - **RBTC/USD**: `0x5295f30436b2077a67c02001f62e8aabcc6688d87a8ce8db6f2b7a7cad4f0b01`\r\n  - **RIF/USD**: `0x3c7ba811cb33ad3784389a580af1a657ce0ebd701b1eb415eafabe5a4885e92f`\r\n- Other relevant smart contract addresses for API3 on RSK Testnet are:\r\n  - **DapiServer**: `0x3A09C138609F4b944EB7B8F0730e1972C243B33a`\r\n  - **selfServeDapiServerWhitelister**: `0x928922A4e2D3f96Ce72002A5EA7481BEF4F12fD6`\r\n- API3 price feed for RBTC and RIF are not available on RSK Mainnet for the purposes of this bounty.\r\n- To access prices feeds:\r\n  - Use the [API3 `readDataFeedWithId()` method](https://docs.api3.org/dapis/developers/read-data-feed-with-id.html).\r\n  - Use the [API3 `readDataFeedValueWithId()` method](https://docs.api3.org/dapis/developers/read-data-feed-value-with-id.html).\r\n  - For your convenience, a [demo repo is available](https://github.com/Ashar2shahid/data-feed-reader-example-rsk-testnet),\r\n    which demonstrates how to do this.\r\n\r\nDo you have questions, comments, or clarifications?\r\nReach out to the reviewers on the [RSK community slack: developers.rsk.co/slack](https://developers.rsk.co/slack) in the `#bounties` channel;\r\nand on the [API3 discord: discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W](https://discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W) in the `#dev-support` channel.\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n- This bounty starts on 15/08/2022\r\n- This bounty accepts submissions until 15/09/2022\r\n",

If you're not familiar with this concept - there is a [dedicated page about that](https://wtfisqf.com/)\r\n\r\nWe at Everscale, have the [Ever DAO](https://everdao.net) tool for decision-making. For the distribution itself, we still use a simple multi-signature smart contract, which seems to be a limited solution, causing coordination overheads and raising the collusion issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Gitcoin DAO, there is a Grants platform, which solves these issues. It became a leading public funding tool for web3. Gitcoin DAO employs the Quadratic Funding mechanism for years to fund open-source projects.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to build a dApp that will implement the project matching and public funds distribution protocol based on individual token contributions. \r\n\r\nNote: the Sybil Resistance issue is out of the scope of this bounty, but we highly encourage you to elaborate on that topic\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Resources \r\n\r\nThe [Ever DAO](https://everdao.net) is a simple proposal/voting smart contract system, which is capable to execute custom logic upon a successful vote. The [OctusBridge](https://octusbridge.io) DAO uses the same contracts to operate the OctusBridge configurations and manage its treasury.\r\n\r\nSee how [Ever DAO (OctusBridge DAO) contracts](https://github.com/broxus/octusbridge-contracts) are implemented and [connected to the web-based dApp](https://github.com/broxus/octusbridge-frontend)",

A highly composable system provides recombinant components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.\r\n\r\nComposability means that elements can be put together in a variety of ways, and still work. It gives the creator flexibility to create something that operates in a new way or a new order. \r\n\r\n## Examples of composable building blocks in the Everscale ecosystem\r\n\r\n* [DexPair](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/DexPair.sol) and [StablePair](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/DexAccount.sol)\r\n* [Token Factory](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/TokenFactory.sol)\r\n* FlatQube Dex [DAO & Farming Contracts](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-dao-contracts)\r\n\r\nIn this bounty, we invite you to build a smart contract system that executes a pipeline of simple interactions with existing building blocks. As an example, below we provide a list of ideas that can use a [FlatQube](https://flatqube.io) DEX smart contracts as building blocks. \r\n\r\nNote, that you can pick any products from the Everscale ecosystem as building blocks. We suggest you build around DEX because it's the easiest way to create something actually helpful. \r\n\r\nThe quality of smart contracts would be the main judging criterion for this bounty. However, we encourage you to build at least a simple frontend dApp for the demo.\r\n\r\n# Ideas\r\n\r\n### Strategy builder\r\nCreate a \"Strategy builder\" dApp, which allows users to configure and deploy a smart contract. The app should allow the execution of the following pipelines. \r\n\r\n- receive token + swap a preconfigured portion of them + optionally send to preconfigured recipient address\r\n- receive token + swap to multiple tokens according to configuration + rebalancing logic + withdraw method\r\n- receive token + swap in 50/50 proportion + provide liquidity to pool + receive LP + lock LP into farming pool + claim rewards method with optional recipient address\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to connect one pipeline to another.\r\n\r\n### Gasless wallet\r\n- Wallet with logic for maintaining preconfigured gas balance\r\n- Each transfer implicitly triggers an additional transfer of tokens to the Gas Giver contract \r\n- The Gas Giver contract should periodically swap collected tokens to EVERs to maintain its balance\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a GitHub repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo, and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made.  \r\n\r\nThe project **submission deadline is Nov 28th**.\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\n\r\n* IMPACT & USEFULNESS: How impactful and useful the submission is in the Everscale ecosystem as a whole \r\n* ORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION: How new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies \r\n* MASS USABILITY: How feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations \r\n* TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY: What is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission \r\n* CLARITY: How clear or easily understood the documentation, examples, and pitch video is \r\n* TEAM DIVERSITY: How diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nDecember, the 7th, 2022\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [FlatQube DEX](https://flatqube.io) ([contracts source code](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts))\r\n- [Yield optimizer around FlatQube farm pools](https://github.com/Black-INK-finance/contracts)\r\n- [Tutorial for advanced onchain token management](https://tip3-onboarding.gitbook.io/)\r\n\r\n## Join the Everscale Dev Community\r\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/everscale)\r\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/EverscaleSmartContracts)\r\n\r\n## Onboarding samples and stuff\r\n\r\n#### Everscale general concepts\r\n* [Terminology](https://docs.everscale.network/learn/terminology)\r\n* [Architecture](https://docs.everscale.network/arch)\r\n\r\n#### Solidity\r\nEverscale Solidity compiler implementation is a bit different from the original EVM compiler.\r\n\r\n* [Everscale Solidity data structures, instructions, and keywords (full reference)](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler/blob/master/API.md)\r\n* [Framework for setting up smart-contract development environment](https://github.com/broxus/locklift)\r\n\r\n#### FT\r\n\r\n* Reference implementation: https://github.com/broxus/tip3\r\n* Standard: https://docs.everscale.network/standard/TIP-3.2\r\n",

The changes that need to be made to the SDK can be published directly as pull requests on Ylide Github.\r\n* **Event as a format:** create the \u201cevent\u201d message format - it should be displayed in the mailbox in a special way (name, date, time, participants), and the recipient can add it to the calendar (via .ics, for example).\r\n* **Fancy QR-code generator for Ylide Mail:** make a cute QR-code business card generator ([example card](https://knowtechie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/knowtechie-instagram-qr-code.jpg)) but with the Ylide address. When it is scanned the Ylide Mail is opened with an option to add the respective address to the contacts list or compose a mail directly (you need a mini-tool to generate a nice QR + pull request additional functionality in our mailbox repo).\r\n* **Ylide browser extension:** make a browser extension that draws the \"Write to Ylide\" icon next to all Everscale/Ethereum addresses (provided that the address is registered in Ylide)\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a GitHub repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo, a link to the live dApp (if any), and an article that explains how the application works.

                "body": "### Prize Bounty\r\n1st Place - 10,000 ALGO\r\n2nd Place - 7,500 ALGO\r\n3rd place - 5,000 ALGO\r\n### Challenge Description\r\nGaming NFTs are difficult to price correctly because their value is heavily weighted towards what they offer in-game and less correlated to common data like name, image or rank, AlgoSeas PIRATEs, for example, have 4 in-game stats stored on the NFT as ARC69 metadata: combat, constitution, plunder, and luck. Sales data show that these in-game stats dominate above all else when it comes to valuing a pirate, with combat and constitution being the two most important stats. PIRATEs have been sold anywhere from 1-1,000 Algo. With over 15,000 PIRATEs in circulation and hundreds of pirates listed and sold it can be difficult for buyers and sellers, especially newcomers, to know what the fair value of a pirate is. We need a similarity service that accepts a single NFT and returns similar NFTs that have been recently valued by others (active listings or recent sales) based on weighted property data.\r\nThe service has several interesting challenges:\r\n* Pirates always change Pirate stats go up and down as pirates level-up, fight, die, and are revived. Keeping track of changing pirate data is important. New pirates are also minted daily so it\u2019s an ever evolving dataset. Some NFT collections don\u2019t change but we expect lots of gaming NFTs and future ARC19 NFTs to have high mutability.\r\n* Tracking current listings and sales - Data is all available via web3 to do it from the blockchain or you can use provided web2 APIs to get this data (see resources section for details).\r\n* Listings vs Sales - A similar pirate that Active listings and sales can both be used for finding similarities. For example the service can find: this NFT is similar to NFT \u201cA\u201d that was sold ~3 days ago for X Algo, and is also similar to NFT \u201cB\u201d that is currently listed for Y Algo.\r\n* Weighted Property Data - How does the service decide which properties are most meaningful? You can come up with your own heuristic or you could analyze bulk sales data to try and compute weights.\r\n\r\nAll of the data needed for this challenge re tracking NFTs, listings, and sales is available via web3 or one can use the AlgoSeas APIs to get this data (see Resources section for details) \r\n\r\nThe challenge is open-ended but the service should effectively answer this question: \u201cGiven an NFT what are the closest N active listings and what are the closest N recent sales for this NFT?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt minimum the response needs to contain the asset IDs that are most similar but it could also provide other data like the algo amount, date it occurred, whether it is a listing or a sale, a \u201csimilarity score\u201d (how close your service thinks these two NFTs are to each other), etc.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, and a recorded demo, working CLI, or live API that can be called (for determining the latency criteria).\r\nWe prefer the service to be written in TypeScript but will accept solutions in JavaScript or Python. This service will be folded into the AlgoSeas platform and maintained by the development team. We do not expect any frontend development for the challenge but if you want to build anything for demo purposes and to be usable by the team we prefer React.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made\r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a community vote that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November The community vote will primarily be for voting on NFT similarity and will be hosted in the AlgoSeas Discord.\r\nTwo representatives from AlgoSeas and two other judges (by invitation) will also assess each project submission by  17:00 EST on Monday the 14th of November. The following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\n#### FUNCTIONAL\r\nDoes it work when run against any pirate AssetID? Are the similar results provided reasonable? How do your results for a specific assetID compare to those of other submissions? Does it work when Pirate metadata is updated or when new Pirates are minted?\r\n#### LATENCY\r\nHow long does it take to get results from your service? Latency will be determined by running a series of requests and taking the p90 latency.\r\n#### EXTENSIBILITY\r\nHow generic is your solution, could it be easily applied to other NFT collections? Some examples of collections that it can be applied to include \u201cAlvatars: Tile Fighters\u201d or Alchemon.\r\n#### WOW FACTOR\r\nHackers always do surprising things. Thought of something that would be really cool to have that isn\u2019t listed here? Go for it and you can earn bonus points from this category!\r\n### Terms\r\nAll submitted code will be considered usable by the AlgoSeas team, regardless of whether or not the participants are chosen to receive a prize bounty. Additionally, refer to the Participation Agreement for full details.\r\nWinner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter. Ecosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\nResources\r\nAlgoSeas IndexerAPI - https://algoexplorer.io/api-dev/indexer-v2\r\nAlgoSeas Discord - https://discord.gg/HKQAGXKJc3\r\nAlgoSeas Discord Sales Channel - https://discord.gg/pf898W2U2j\r\n[Pirate NFT Creator address (NEX7N2...)](https://algoexplorer.io/address/NEX7N2U36UHBTRHJA4T3WEOOGYMPXL56ICNO4CCJAJBYFJSA7PZJU33H7U)\r\n[AlgoSeas Marketplace address (7SSZH\u2026)](https://algoexplorer.io/address/7SSZHWXNWMY3AV6HV5PTF3R2BPH67BMQPCCXWYQWUPHUKE6E4PA5QUOQSU)\r\nhttps://algoseas.io/marketplace\r\nhttps://algoseas.io/marketplace/collection/AlgoSeas%20Pirates \r\n#### GET Active Pirate Listings API\r\n[https://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/listings?type=listing&sortBy=price&sortAscending=true&collectionName=AlgoSeas Pirates&limit=500](https://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/listings?type=listing&sortBy=price&sortAscending=true&collectionName=AlgoSeas) \r\n#### GET Recent Pirate Sales API\r\nhttps://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/sales?collectionName=AlgoSeas%20Pirates&sortBy=time&sortAscending=false&limit=500\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate",

Gitcoin relies on many contributors to review grants - and we know that other funders of public goods do as well.  \r\n\r\nIn this challenge, you will analyze a dataset that includes all grant applications from the end of grants round 14 until the start of grants round 15 as well as all the grants that were approved during grants round 15.   \r\n\r\n## Submission Requirements\r\nTo submit your entries, please follow the instructions on the Gitcoin hackathon site to submit your analysis.  \r\n\r\n## Judging Criteria\r\nUsing the information provided as well as any other on-chain information you would like to gather, please make observations about how to grade grants for their eligibility.  \r\n\r\n## Winner Announcement Date\r\n #### Winners will be announced on Halloween - October 31, 2022.   \r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nWe want this hackathon to help spark a broader open data science community.  And remember communities are just humans collaborating to solve problems and have fun - so please get in touch and discuss your thoughts and approaches and questions with the judges.  \r\n\r\nThere is a hackathon channel in the Gitcoin discord called #FDD-hackathon. Join the Gitcoin discord and click on the lightbulb emoji to get a role that enables you to see the channel.  You can join the Gitcoin discord here:  [https://discord.gg/gitcoin](https://discord.gg/gitcoin)\r\n\r\nPlease find a dataset that includes all grant applications from the end of grants round 14 until the start of grants round 15 as well as all the grants that were approved during grants round 15 here:    \r\n[OpenData Hackathon](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17OdrV7SA0I56aDMwqxB6jMwoY3tjSf5w\r\n)\r\n\r\n",

Except our Next.ID's DID bindings, we are also fetching the identity relation from different data sources like `rss3`, `keybase` and `knn3`. \r\n\r\n`relation_server` fetch data from [Upstream](https://docs.next.id/relation-service/rs-intro#upstreams)s\r\nWhen performing a data fetching process, RelationService will\r\n\r\n- Iter all available upstreams which can handle this query\r\n- Request and collect results from each upstream available\r\n- Newly fetched data will be fed into this circulation again, until no new data is yield.\r\n\r\nTo better understand how it will be processed, you could also check [Web5.bio](https://twitter.com/HominLuo/status/1574448473637724161). We are aiming to bring the identity graph to the social graph next year. To better support this goal, we need more data sources to be available in `relation_server`. \r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- Understand how does [GraphQL](https://docs.next.id/relation-service/rs-graphql) work. We need you to clean up and match the data structure we currently supported. About how does `relation_server` currently run, the actual code can be found at [src/upstream/mod.rs](https://github.com/nextdotid/relation_server/blob/develop/src/upstream/mod.rs) -> pub async fn fetch_all() definition. \r\n- The new data source you want to work on should not be our current-supported one. \r\n[ProofService](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-intro)\r\n[Keybase](https://keybase.io/)\r\n[SybilList](https://github.com/Uniswap/sybil-list/blob/master/verified.json)\r\n[RSS3](https://rss3.io/network/api.html)\r\n[KNN3](https://docs.knn3.xyz/graphql)\r\n[CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.me/)\r\nETH Leaderboard\r\nTheGraph for\r\n[ENS](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ensdomains/ens)\r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $2000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) before starting your hacking.

For now, `proof_server` performs `proof_post` fetching by API or single HTTP GET. \r\n\r\n`proof_server` is designed to prove \"An [Identity](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-identity) and an [Avatar](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-avatar) is held by the same person\".\r\n\r\nLet's take this assertion into 2 parts:\r\n\r\n\"I\" hold this Avatar.\r\n\"I\" hold this identity.\r\n1 equals \"Generate a signature using secret key of this Avatar\".\r\n\r\n2 equals \"Make an action using this identity\".\r\n\r\nHere we reach 1 and 2 with [Proof Post](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-proof-post) mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo make `proof_server` supports more and more services, we want our community endorsers to help us bring platforms like `facebook`, `xbox`, `instagram` etc. to be available on `proof_server`. \r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- The new platform should be able to let users themselves to using `proof_post` prove their identity. \r\n- The new platform should be a new platform that `proof_server` is not available now. Please check our current supported [Platform List](https://docs.next.id/rest-api/platforms). \r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $1000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) to understand our mechanism before starting your hacking. You will need to **create a pr** to this repo to submit your work.\r\n\r\n## Contact Info\r\n\r\n@hominluo @nykma here or Telegram for any question regarding how to work on Next.ID.",

But in real world, there may be no way for some `platform`s to do this way. Including:\r\n\r\n- No APIs at all provided by `platform`\r\n- API needs each user to do an `OAuth` to fetch their own data\r\n- API has very strict quota and will finally exceed if `proof_service` users grows.\r\n- User data cannot be fetched by single `HTTP GET` (e.g. JavaScript-driven `XHR` is performed in that page)\r\n- HTML DOM struct is changed frequently, can't define a fixed selector to query the data from DOM tree.\r\n- Remote HTTP server has a strict anti-bot mechanism, single `HTTP GET` will be blocked in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nTo make `proof_server` supports more and more services later, we need a headless browser to simulate normal user's page-browsing flow.\r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- The headless browser module can be kind of independent from current `proof_server`'s code structure. With a simple wrapper, `proof_server` can communicate with it in different processes.\r\n- The headless browser module will find user's proof post using single `regexp`, instead of parsing and `css-style` selecting DOM.\r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $3000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) before starting your hacking. You will need to **create a pr** to this repo to submit your work.\r\n\r\n## Contact Info\r\n\r\n@hominluo @nykma here or Telegram for any question regarding how to work on Next.ID.",

In web 2 we have established patterns for event architecture and publisher / subscriber model. For example all the consumers can listen to a source of an event and all the subscribers are notified when a certain even happens. In case of Algorand Blockchain, we have to poll the explorer to get status of events for example whether the transaction has been confirmed on chain, is the atomic swap has been completed or not. All the applications having this use case  are writing their own logic for popping the blockchain. We are looking to build a solution that will enable subscribing to events on the blockchain and all the subscribers will be notified in real time of the various events they subscribe to.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. \r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a quadratic community voting element to the judging process that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November. \r\nFour judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by Monday the 14th of November. \r\n\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\nIMPACT & USEFULNESS:\r\nHow impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole\r\nORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION:\r\nHow new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies\r\nMASS USABILITY:\r\nHow feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations\r\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:\r\nWhat is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission\r\nCLARITY:\r\nHow clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is\r\nTEAM DIVERSITY:\r\nHow diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.\r\nEcosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\n### Resources\r\nDeveloper.algorand.org\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/\r\nhttps://github.com/algorand-devrel\r\nAlgorand Discord - https://discord.gg/Algorand\r\n\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate\r\n",

Content, products, and data will be created and owned by users.\r\n\r\nThis challenge is to explore connecting GameFi to the real world's productivity. How does GameFi incentivize its creators? How does GameFi combine the sales and application of robo-vehicle in the real world? How to combine it with the governance of a DAO? Most importantly, this challenge should avoid taking the game out of its essence and becoming a Ponzi scheme.\r\n\r\nPlease facilitate participants in the Game Design Planning challenge to elaborate on why this game could bring great fun to its players and connect to the real world's productivity.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission needs to include the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u25cf Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.  \r\n\u25cf Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.  \r\n\u25cf Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.  \r\n\u25cf You can continue to optimize your proposal by getting feedback from other participants/challenges.  \r\n\u25cf The final submission is one PDF format document (1920 \u00d7 1080p, 16:9) with some infographics. We only accept the original projects, it cannot be anything you have done before this Hackathon.  \r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nPanel assessment on the project's innovation and feasibility.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nNov 7th\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nKeep up with announcements about this challenge \ud83d\udc49[Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/Ge3U7BfjxC)  \r\nCheck the Game Design Planning challenge\u2019s output \ud83d\udc49 [Issue 1](https://github.com/DeAutoDAO/Hackathon_-I-Game-Robot/issues/1)  \r\nMeet other participants \ud83d\udc49 [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/CHdW29G3Ee)  \r\nRead this article to understand why and how to achieve democratic innovation of robo-vehicle manufacturing \ud83d\udc49[Medium](https://medium.com/@nancylee007)  \r\nKnow more about DeAuto\u2019s ultimate vision \ud83d\udc49 [Official Website](https://www.deauto.io/)  ",

Maximum 20 teams will be awarded.)\r\n\r\n*All prizes will be paid out in FIL and outside of Gitcoin.\r\n\r\n**### Challenge Description**\r\n\r\nProjects that use [IPFS](http://docs.ipfs.io/) for content-addressing and/or [Filecoin](http://docs.filecoin.io/) for decentralized, persistent storage. (Submissions that use either technology indirectly via [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/), [Libp2p,](https://libp2p.io/) or other tooling also qualify). All types of projects are welcome and we welcome your creativity. Feel free to browse past winners [here](https://hackathons.filecoin.io/#hall-of-fame) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nAt a minimum submissions for prizes should include the following items:\r\n\r\n**1. Project Description**\r\n- The name and summary of the project\r\n- Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact info (e.g., GitHub handle, email address, or other)\r\n- How the project uses IPFS and/or Filecoin and/or decentralized storage services that build on top of either with example links to where in code those technologies are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Link to the publicly visible source code repository**\r\n- Provide comprehensive README, incl. a clear description of the work and mention of how our tech is used in the Technologies Used section of README.\r\n- Include a link to the working demo or provide a testing guide\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Showcase**\r\n- 2-3 minute video that presents the idea, including a brief demo that demonstrates the use of IPFS and/or Filecoin or anything that builds on top of them\r\n- If applicable, select the appropriate track when submitting the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nOnly submit what you have built specifically for this hackathon. Submitting a project previously submitted to any other of our hackathons will lead to disqualification\r\nOnly projects or features (preferably in separate branch) built specifically for the respective hackathon will be considered for prizes\r\nBroken links may disqualify the project from the judging process.\r\nUsing an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn\u2019t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nOur judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories: 1) Design, 2) Novelty/Originality, 3) Technical Accomplishment, 4) Potential Impact, 5) Creativity/Fun. Submissions will be rated with decimal numbers between 0 (worst) - 5 (best) per category (max score: 25). The final score is the average of all voting judges. If a project scores low, we reserve the right not to award prizes, even if it was the only project submitted to a given track.\r\n\r\n- \ud83e\udd29\u00a0**Novelty/Creativity:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way? Does it solve a new problem? Is it creative and puts a smile on people\u2019s faces?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83d\ude80 Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market? Is it\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\ude84\u00a0Filecoin & IPFS Implementation:** Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieving a CID from a gateway)? Does it use NFT.storage, web3.storage, or other storage helpers? Does it deploy a solidity smart contract to Filecoin Virtual Machine to compute over the stored data?\r\n\r\n- **\u2728Design:** How is the UX/UI/DX? Is it easy to use? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive? Does the visual design delight you?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny winners will be notified after the event is over with specific instructions (including but not limited to filling out the necessary tax information) on how to claim their prize. Failure to provide the appropriate information within the timeframe specified in the winner notification message could mean delayed payment or claim rejection.\r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nWinners will be announced after the end of the 2022 Gitcoin Social Hour.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [Additional information on eligibility criteria](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82)\r\n- [Getting Started with IPFS & Filecoin](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Getting-Started-With-IPFS-Filecoin-c00526cf97ba4087ba5c3ad5f5337a58)\r\n- [IPFS & Filecoin Discord](https://discord.gg/Ymp3XZPH9V)\r\n- [Community Office Hours](https://bitly.protocol.ai/Community-Office-Hours)\r\n- [30-minute introduction on how to build with IPFS & Filecoin](https://youtu.be/5-0_DqXGY-M)",

This change would allow us to build another apps with exactly the same indexing functionality as in Navigator and also to improve it for all apps at the same time.\r\n\r\nRoom DB must be used only for keeping list of folders after solving this task. Index will be kept in memory of `arklib` process. We should guarantee that `arklib` is not killed as long as app instance lives. Even better if we can keep it live longer than the app, so if we restarted the app we would not recalculate the index. If this is not possible, we will need to create persistence of index (cache), see https://github.com/ARK-Builders/ARK-Navigator/issues/142 and https://github.com/ARK-Builders/arklib/issues/15 for more details.",

The decentralized app should reward existing customers with an application token when a specific action is taken or some time in membership has elapsed. The exact conditions are not specified but could be for recruiting new members to an organization, a website, or discord channel. Members may be rewarded for performing specific operations like answering questions for new users or being in an organization for a certain length of time. The application should support adding or modifying reward conditions and amounts. These conditions should be implemented in smart contracts and triggered by using one of the Algorand SDKs. The loyalty token should be redeemable for additional member benefits like additional privileges or exchangeable for merchandise at a given level. \r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. \r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a quadratic community voting element to the judging process that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November. \r\nFour judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by Monday the 14th of November. \r\n\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\nIMPACT & USEFULNESS:\r\nHow impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole\r\nORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION:\r\nHow new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies\r\nMASS USABILITY:\r\nHow feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations\r\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:\r\nWhat is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission\r\nCLARITY:\r\nHow clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is\r\nTEAM DIVERSITY:\r\nHow diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.\r\nEcosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\n### Resources\r\nDeveloper.algorand.org\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/\r\nhttps://github.com/algorand-devrel\r\nAlgorand Discord - https://discord.gg/Algorand\r\n\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate\r\n",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "## Description\r\nCreate an Agoric governance component using a new ElectionType that instantiates a public vote to give voting facets to the election winners. There should be a public registration of the identities of the candidates to make them visible.\r\n\r\nThis bounty focuses on creating the committee that will be elected and includes a charter to control the manner of their election and operation. Our existing committee is elected only once, and the membership can't be updated. The biggest open issues are refreshing the membership, and controlling the ability to create new votes.\r\n\r\nPossible approaches to membership include replacing members who have become unresponsive, scheduling periodic elections, or supporting recalls. There are several plausible ways to limit the ability to open new questions: a chair or subcommittee, require approval from some subset of the members, or requiring a payment or deposit.\r\n\r\nThis bounty shouldn't include any work on those who vote to elect this committee. Internally, those processes are currently under review.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nCurrently, voters only get a voting facet via an invitation. The electors vote to choose a committee, and the committee members then get the ability to vote. The voters can reliably identify the Electorate by subscribing to get a list of new questions. Voters can use the questionHandle from each update from the subscription to get the questionDetails. They cast their vote by sending their selected position(s) to their electorate, which they know and trust.\r\n\r\nWe want everyone to be able to identify the candidates and winners. Anyone who knows the electorate can get a list of questions, so this includes both the original electorate and the elected committee members for the original election, and then the committee itself will be well-known, and so both the public and the committee members can find out what questions the committee is voting on.\r\n\r\nThis structure of Electorates and VoteCounters allows voters and observers to verify how votes will be counted, and who can vote on them, but doesn't constrain the process of creating questions. We now have a PSMCharter and EconCommittee Charter, that control aspects of creating questions that those committees can vote on. A charter or electionManager can control the voting threshold, the vote closing time, or the range of parameter values that can be specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nA successful bounty will:\r\n* Complete the requirements from the description including reasonable edge cases not explicitly defined\r\n* Pass code review from Agoric team\r\n* Include documented open source code and walkthrough presentation\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\nAbout One Week\r\n\r\n## Reward\r\n$3200\r\n\r\nPayment will be made in USD (fiat currency) via wire transfer. The developer is responsible for providing their completed tax documents (W9 for US based developers and/or W8 or W8-BEN-E for non-US based developers) and providing their banking details in order to receive payment. \r\n\r\n## Applicant Assessment Criteria\r\nImportant: Please provide a clear work plan for how you will approach this bounty.  Use the work plan as an initial demonstration that you would be a good candidate.  Bounties will require coordination with the Agoric team, so unfortunately only plans submitted in English will be considered.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n* Issue-specific domain experience\r\n* Issue-specific technical capability\r\n* Familiarity with Agoric's platform\r\n* JavaScript experience\r\n* Availability and communication\r\n\r\n## Experience Write-up (1000-1500 words)\r\nAs part of completing the bounty, we ask that you write up a short summary of your experience building on Agoric. Write-up should include:\r\n* Begin with a compelling, relevant introductory hook statement (<50 words). \r\n* Clearly explain the specific bounty project (~100 words). \r\n* Describe how the developer approached the problem (~300 words). \r\n* Give a step-by-step description of the solution (>500 words && <1000 words).\r\n* At least three code snippets per write-up. They do not count toward overall word count. \r\n* Conclude with clear calls to action on developing with Agoric - specifically how any ambition developer reading this piece could do more themselves (>150 words). \r\n\r\nThis is important feedback for us as we evolve the platform.\r\n\r\n## Review Process\r\n* Agoric team reviews your submitted work plan on Gitcoin.\r\n* It is best to join our Discord and post your Gitcoin name in the bounties channel, so that we can follow up with you. Otherwise, we will write on your Gitcoin profile wall and say hello!\r\n* Agoric contacts you to provide reference projects / sample code for engineering review.\r\n* Introductory call to discuss your plans and expected timeline.\r\n* Join the Agoric Discord bounties channel (if you haven\u2019t done so already).\r\n* Agoric accepts you on Gitcoin and you get started!\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Agoric Documentation](https://docs.agoric.com/)\r\n* [Agoric Governance Doc](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/governance)\r\n* [#bounties channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/854426485900967988) for general questions and your private bounty channel for direct questions to the Agoric team",

Fairdrive, a personal data store, is looking to support such a dApp which would allow its users to access their stored data to generate NFTs. Leveraging the provided library, the goal is to correctly connect the metadata of the content and the image.\r\n\r\nAs a User, I would like an NFT Generator dApp connected to Fairdrive that allows me to select an image and mint as NFT in xDai saved to Swarm, so that I can expand on the value of my data stored in Fairdrive. \r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n\r\n- Familiarize with the repo containing Fairdrive: https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp\r\n- Familiarize yourself with the SwarmNFT.js: https://github.com/igar1991/SwarmNFT\r\n- Create Repo on Github that contains code\r\n- Create Generator dApp that follows the process below:\r\n    - Open the NFT Generator dApp\r\n    - Connect to Fairdrive\r\n    - Select a folder of images in Fairdrive\r\n    - Select a specific a specific image\r\n    - Use selected image to Generate an NFT\r\n    - NFT to be minted on xDai\r\n    - Newly minted NFT to be stored to Swarm\r\n\r\n\r\n**Approving criteria**\r\n\r\n- A new public repo is opened with open source code and a link to the repo is in the Gitcoin issue. \r\n- Include Readme file with instructions on how to use the app\r\n- Use open source license Apache 2.0\r\n- User's have the ability to open an NFT Generator, connected to Fairdrive that allows them to select an image to mint as NFT in xDai saved to Swarm.\r\n-\r\n\r\n**Timeline**\r\n\r\n- Due 15th Feb 2022\r\n\r\nUse the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KrVTmahcUA) for more information and support.\r\n\r\nMind the [Fair Data Society Principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/) in your tasks.",

It enables us to more easily navigate the world around us and find places of interest.\r\n- Maintaining relevant maps on a global scale is a massive effort that just a few (commercial) providers are able to tackle to an appropriate degree - thereby only a couple of large players are present. Providing maps and services on top of them gives them a competitive edge and certain power over the market of all the services connected to them.\r\n- Project Galileo builds on top of FairOS which uses Swarm\u2019s decentralized storage. It is tackling two aspects that are crucial to solving the above problems: how can decentralized storage and tech be used to host the geodata and how can communities be engaged to contribute and be properly compensated for the contributions.\r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n- Familiarize with the repo containing Galileo : https://github.com/fairDataSociety/galileo\r\n- Familiarize yourself with the rendered content on the Galileo webpage: https://app.galileo.fairdatasociety.org/  \r\n- Follow the instructions in the Galileo repo (https://github.com/fairDataSociety/galileo#readme ) on \"How to create and share your own map?\"\r\n- Use the instructions to contribute the **map of Kenya**; take notes where instructions might be improved   \r\n\r\n**Approving criteria**\r\n- Map of **Kenya** is visible on the Galileo webpage\r\n- Feedback on instructions is given, with possible improvements noted (something between 250 -500 words)\r\n\r\n**Timeline**\r\n- Deadline: 15th Feb 2022\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n[Swarm documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/).\r\n[FairOS documentation](https://docs.fairos.fairdatasociety.org/docs/).\r\nUse the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.gg/KrVTmahcUA) for more information and support.\r\nMind the [Fair Data Society Principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/) in your tasks.",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

Or for a cool new thing that can now exist because of the Reserve Protocol? Or something that you expect to be useful to others building or actors in the Reserve ecosystem?\r\n\r\nYes? Then read on!\r\n\r\n**Want to create a product on the platform? Here\u2019s some things to think about:**\r\n\r\nAt Reserve, we see our new protocol as a platform for people to launch products and even businesses on. So go ahead, build and pitch your product idea. Come up with a clever, catchy brand. Figure out the economics for how this can be sustainable for this system, and maybe even for you as a builder. Build new collateral plugins or leverage existing one. Fork the [Register.app](https://register.app/) repo and create a custom website and interface to mint it, redeem it, and stake/unstake RSR.\r\n\r\nShould there be a flywheel that builds up treasury tokens for increased voting power in defi? Should it instead fund marketing operations? How much AUM and revenue is needed to do that?\r\n\r\nWhat is the \u201crisk / reward\u201d profile of this token? Is it high yield, high risk? Low yield, low risk? Something else? Do the collateral plugins exist? Do they need to be written?\r\n\r\nThis is for you to decide and invent. Feel free to leverage any and all content we\u2019ve created for inspiration or just use your team\u2019s own \ud83e\udde0.\r\n\r\n**Want to create a tool for the ecosystem? Here\u2019s some things to think about:**\r\n\r\nThere are two main constituents in our ecosystem: 1) governors / stakers and 2) RToken holders. These groups have some similar, but many different needs and potential pain points. \r\n\r\nThere are also other smaller but no less critical roles in the ecosystem: Gaurdians, Pausers, \u201ceconomic designers\u201d. Economic designers might need to know more than a typical yield-farmer: other risk factors, how those interplay and overlap with other types of collateral, etc. Pausers and Gaurdians need to be on-call with varying SLAs and be able to make fairly quick decisions based on data that is not at their fingertips.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\n- Links to implementation repositories (github, gitlab, etc). Include in that repository:\r\n    - Project description\r\n    - Links to live project, if applicable (recommended)\r\n- Demo Video\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria for your Creation\r\n\r\nOur single overriding criterion for judging submissions is the importance of your project to the overall Reserve ecosystem, as determined by the Reserve judges.\r\n\r\nThe bigger this thing could make the overall ecosystem, the more excited we will be about it. \u201cImportance\u201d is admittedly vague, but is composed mostly of the following subcriteria:\r\n\r\n- Completeness of project.\r\n- Anticipated usefulness of project (i.e. viability for a product).\r\n- Safety of project to all constituents.\r\n- Quality of project (code, design, economics).\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n>\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n>\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n** ### Acceptance Criteria **\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n> \r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/) + Intro Video\r\n- How the Protocol Works Video",

The prize bounty will be split amongst the top 3 submissions with 1st place receiving $3,500, 2nd place receiving $1,000, and 3rd place receiving $500.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\nThis is a special Devcon themed challenge to build the best air gapped wallet asset verification experience. We want everyone to benefit from a more streamlined and simplified wallet asset verification process where the assets that need to be verified can only be accessed on a separate \u201cair gapped\u201d system. Both systems can be connected to a network, but the incentive should capture the ability to verify any wallet owned assets where that wallet does not want to be exposed to a broader network.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this challenge is to simply verify an offline high value wallet asset with an online mobile wallet or device. For example, imagine that you want to verify a high value NFT that lives in your Ledger or Trezor wallet to gain entry to an exclusive event, you prove ownership of the asset but not be required to bring your hardware wallet to the event and be required to connect and sign a message in a crowded public space. How could you perform the same verification with your mobile phone that still allows the event to assert your ownership of the asset?\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nSubmissions must be a valid public GitHub repository containing the open source code for an air gapped wallet asset verification solution. All submissions must be received by October 28th, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThe prize pool will be split among valid submissions at the discretion of a panel of Shopify blockchain team judges. Scoring parameters include the UX, ingenuity/innovation, simplicity, and visual flair. There will be 10 points for UX, 5 each for all remaining parameters for a total of 25 points. \r\n\r\nYour submission must demonstrate the ability to verify one or more air gapped wallet assets such as NFTs and other tokens, as well as verify any quantities or attributes defined by those tokens.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be notified by November 4th, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST. Prize payouts will be completed by November 10, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST. \r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThis challenge is being sponsored by the blockchain team at Shopify. We want to engage the community and create a challenge opportunity for teams to create a fun and exciting product that will benefit the Ethereum community as a whole. The winners of the challenge will receive a monetary prize and the notoriety that comes with building something amazing that people want to use in their projects.

                "body": "## Description\r\nCreate an Agoric governance component using a VoteCounter that correctly evaluates election results for [instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting). \r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThe only vote counter currently is the BinaryVoteCounter, which presumes there are two positions on the ballot and assigns every vote to one or the other or to 'spoiled'. At the end, it looks for a majority winner and announces that. It can be configured to have one of the possible outcomes as the default outcome. If there's a tie and no default, the winner is undefined.\r\n\r\nContractGovernance uses this to make 'no change' be the default when voting on parameter changes.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nA successful bounty will:\r\n* Complete the requirements from the description including reasonable edge cases not explicitly defined\r\n* Pass code review from Agoric team\r\n* Include documented open source code and walkthrough presentation\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\nOne Week\r\n\r\n## Reward\r\n$3,200\r\n\r\nPayment will be made in USD (fiat currency) via wire transfer. The developer is responsible for providing their completed tax documents (W9 for US based developers and/or W8 or W8-BEN-E for non-US based developers) and providing their banking details in order to receive payment. \r\n\r\n## Applicant Assessment Criteria\r\nImportant: Please provide a clear work plan for how you will approach this bounty.  Use the work plan as an initial demonstration that you would be a good candidate.  Bounties will require coordination with the Agoric team, so unfortunately only plans submitted in English will be considered.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n* Issue-specific domain experience\r\n* Issue-specific technical capability\r\n* Familiarity with Agoric's platform\r\n* JavaScript experience\r\n* Availability and communication\r\n\r\n## Experience Write-up (1000-1500 words)\r\nAs part of completing the bounty, we ask that you write up a short (or long!) summary of your experience building on Agoric. Write-up should:\r\n* Begin with a compelling, relevant introductory hook statement (<50 words). \r\n* Clearly explain the specific bounty project (~100 words). \r\n* Describe how the developer approached the problem (~300 words). \r\n* Give a step-by-step description of the solution (>500 words && <1000 words).\r\n* At least three code snippets per write-up. They do not count toward overall word count. \r\n* Conclude with clear calls to action on developing with Agoric - specifically how any ambition developer reading this piece could do more themselves (>150 words). \r\n\r\nThis is important feedback for us as we evolve the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Review Process\r\n* Agoric team reviews your submitted work plan on Gitcoin\r\n* It is best to join our Discord and post your gitcoin name in the bounties channel, so that we can follow up with you. Otherwise, we will write on your gitcoin profile wall and say hello!\r\n* Agoric contacts you to provide reference projects / sample code for engineering review\r\n* Introductory call to discuss your plans and expected timeline\r\n* You join the Agoric Discord bounties channel (if you haven\u2019t done so already) \r\n* Agoric accepts you on Gitcoin and you get started!\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Agoric Documentation](https://docs.agoric.com/)\r\n* [Agoric Governance Doc](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/governance)\r\n* [#bounties channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/854426485900967988) for general questions and your private bounty channel for direct questions to the Agoric team",

This is the first step to achieve our grand vision for a universal and decentralized cross-chain protocol.\r\n\r\nBefore ViteBridge 0.1 goes on mainnet, we want to do our best to ensure security of the protocol. As part of this, we encourage developers and security researchers to put our security to the test \u2014 and we offer a variety of rewards for the ViteBridge Bug Bounty Program.\r\n\r\n**Program Rules**\r\n\r\n- You must be the first person to report the issue to us. We will review duplicate bugs to see if they provide additional information, but otherwise only reward the first reporter.\r\n- We award bounties at time of fix, and will keep you posted as we work to resolve them.\r\n- Report identified bugs at https://forms.gle/UkS8DMULq7sv1iXv5\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\nThe ViteBridge 0.1 code is published at https://github.com/vitelabs/vite-asset-bridge\r\n\r\n**Bounty Rewards**\r\n\r\nFor the bug bounty program, we have three tiers of rewards:\r\n\r\n- Tier 1 \u2014 Usability issues that does not cause loss of funds. The bug fix requires manual intervention to adjust parameters ($100 in VITE)\r\n- Tier 2 \u2014 Usability issues that does not cause loss of funds. The bug fix requires redeployment of the smart contract. ($700 in VITE)\r\n- Tier 3 \u2014 Issues causing loss of funds. ($3000 in VITE)\r\n\r\n**Exclusion**\r\n\r\nPlease note this bounty program is only on the code level, not the UI level.",

Maximum 20 teams will be awarded.)\r\n\r\n*All prizes will be paid out in FIL and outside of Gitcoin.\r\n\r\n**### Challenge Description**\r\n\r\nProjects that use [IPFS](http://docs.ipfs.io/) for content-addressing and/or [Filecoin](http://docs.filecoin.io/) for decentralized, persistent storage. (Submissions that use either technology indirectly via [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/), [Libp2p,](https://libp2p.io/) or other tooling also qualify). All types of projects are welcome and we welcome your creativity. Feel free to browse past winners [here](https://hackathons.filecoin.io/#hall-of-fame) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nAt a minimum submissions for prizes should include the following items:\r\n\r\n**1. Project Description**\r\n- The name and summary of the project\r\n- Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact info (e.g., GitHub handle, email address, or other)\r\n- How the project uses IPFS and/or Filecoin and/or decentralized storage services that build on top of either with example links to where in code those technologies are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Link to the publicly visible source code repository**\r\n- Provide comprehensive README, incl. a clear description of the work and mention of how our tech is used in the Technologies Used section of README.\r\n- Include a link to the working demo or provide a testing guide\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Showcase**\r\n- 2-3 minute video that presents the idea, including a brief demo that demonstrates the use of IPFS and/or Filecoin or anything that builds on top of them\r\n- If applicable, select the appropriate track when submitting the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nOnly submit what you have built specifically for this hackathon. Submitting a project previously submitted to any other of our hackathons will lead to disqualification\r\nOnly projects or features (preferably in separate branch) built specifically for the respective hackathon will be considered for prizes\r\nBroken links may disqualify the project from the judging process.\r\nUsing an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn\u2019t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nOur judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories: 1) Design, 2) Novelty/Originality, 3) Technical Accomplishment, 4) Potential Impact, 5) Creativity/Fun. Submissions will be rated with decimal numbers between 0 (worst) - 5 (best) per category (max score: 25). The final score is the average of all voting judges. If a project scores low, we reserve the right not to award prizes, even if it was the only project submitted to a given track.\r\n\r\n- \ud83e\udd29\u00a0**Novelty/Creativity:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way? Does it solve a new problem? Is it creative and puts a smile on people\u2019s faces?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83d\ude80 Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market? Is it\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\ude84\u00a0Filecoin & IPFS Implementation:** Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieving a CID from a gateway)? Does it use NFT.storage, web3.storage, or other storage helpers? Does it deploy a solidity smart contract to Filecoin Virtual Machine to compute over the stored data?\r\n\r\n- **\u2728Design:** How is the UX/UI/DX? Is it easy to use? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive? Does the visual design delight you?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny winners will be notified after the event is over with specific instructions (including but not limited to filling out the necessary tax information) on how to claim their prize. Failure to provide the appropriate information within the timeframe specified in the winner notification message could mean delayed payment or claim rejection.\r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nWinners will be announced after the end of the 2022 Gitcoin Social Hour.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [Additional information on eligibility criteria](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82)\r\n- [Getting Started with IPFS & Filecoin](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Getting-Started-With-IPFS-Filecoin-c00526cf97ba4087ba5c3ad5f5337a58)\r\n- [IPFS & Filecoin Discord](https://discord.gg/Ymp3XZPH9V)\r\n- [Community Office Hours](https://bitly.protocol.ai/Community-Office-Hours)\r\n- [30-minute introduction on how to build with IPFS & Filecoin](https://youtu.be/5-0_DqXGY-M)",

Grant owners - who want to get funds\r\n2. Grant contributors - who want to give their favorite projects funding\r\n3. (optionally) ecosystem builders - who want to support ecosystems of public goods\r\n\r\n<img width=\"624\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-04 at 7 47 45 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513929/199987950-4d4f28a7-7d0a-4b66-ae94-8efe896f9f8e.png\">\r\n\r\nThe application would need to have the following.\r\n1. Create Grant Flow\r\n2. Checkout Flow\r\n3. Add Matching Funds Flow\r\n4. Analytics Module to track contributions\r\n\r\nFrom a technology perspective, we are looking to build this \"right\".  That means good docs, good test coverage, responsive design, maintainable codebase, etc.  I've already validated the market for this with two throwaway builds ([1](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1291746535403741184), [2](https://twitter.com/_FundOSS/status/1410604319498407942)) and we want to invest in a solid codebase to host future web2 grants campaigns.\r\n\r\nIf you are a builder, please submit your application on the gitcoin bounty below.  I will select a builder (or team of builders) to build it in the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nI set the bounty to 10 ETH, but the actual compensation will probably be T&M as we kick off the project.\r\n",

Currently it is relatively easy to generate these two lists.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to check two things then:\r\n1. Is the license of my project compatible with that of the projects I'm reusing?\r\n2. Is the license of the project reusing my project compatible with my project's license?\r\n\r\nSo the idea is that when someone runs a check command, we get a warning if this is not the case. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can store the source data from this table: https://github.com/HansHammel/license-compatibility-checker/tree/f243eb4523ebc7d019a5928103e5b82b59b3b803 into our tool or otherwise collect data here: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/solution/joinup-licensing-assistant/jla-compatibility-checker\r\n\r\nAs our code will be doing hundreds of checks per minute, it's better that we natively store the license data and don't need an API for it.",

This whitelist must include RBTC and RIF.\r\n- (Optional) Enable transfers between RSK network accounts using RNS addresses (e.g. `*.rsk`), in addition to standard addresses (`0x\u2026`)\r\n\r\nThe **fair market price task**:\r\n\r\n- The bot currently requires the seller to manually input the price in a p2p trade\r\n- Instead of this, use price feeds from API3 to query the current price for the trade\r\n- Display this as \u201cfair market price\u201d within the bot, however the seller may still override it\r\n- The buyer should be able to see both the seller\u2019s price and the fair market price\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe **base task**:\r\n\r\n- The code must be publicly visible in a repo on github.com\r\n- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT\r\n- The submission must maintain the baseline functionality of, and support features of, the p2plnbot\r\n  - apart from switching from LN to RSK, if any features need to be removed, please clarify with the reviewers first.\r\n- The bot must have a live deployment, and the `@`-name of the bot must be included in the README within the repo\r\n- Record a video (screen capture) demonstrating the use of the Telegram bot\r\n- Any smart contracts used must be live on an RSK **public** network,\r\n  either RSK Testnet or RSK Mainnet; localhost and/or RSK Regtest is insufficient\r\n\r\nThe **fair market price task**:\r\n\r\n- The fair market price feature must make use of the price feeds from API3\r\n  - Trades occurring on this bot should use RSK Testnet or RSK Mainnet (your choice)\r\n  - Prices displayed in this feature of the bot should access the RBTC and RIF API3 price feeds available on RSK Mainnet only\r\n- API3 price feeds for RBTC and RIF on RSK Testnet are available using the following **Beacon IDs**:\r\n  - **RBTC/BTC**: `0x4aaf6e2ef7fc8280aa99d321e53ef2e4f111b7805677a262eb5882b1a27b5108`\r\n  - **RBTC/USD**: `0x5295f30436b2077a67c02001f62e8aabcc6688d87a8ce8db6f2b7a7cad4f0b01`\r\n  - **RIF/USD**: `0x3c7ba811cb33ad3784389a580af1a657ce0ebd701b1eb415eafabe5a4885e92f`\r\n- Other relevant smart contract addresses for API3 on RSK Testnet are:\r\n  - **DapiServer**: `0x3A09C138609F4b944EB7B8F0730e1972C243B33a`\r\n  - **selfServeDapiServerWhitelister**: `0x928922A4e2D3f96Ce72002A5EA7481BEF4F12fD6`\r\n- API3 price feed for RBTC and RIF are not available on RSK Mainnet for the purposes of this bounty.\r\n- To access prices feeds:\r\n  - Use the [API3 `readDataFeedWithId()` method](https://docs.api3.org/dapis/developers/read-data-feed-with-id.html).\r\n  - Use the [API3 `readDataFeedValueWithId()` method](https://docs.api3.org/dapis/developers/read-data-feed-value-with-id.html).\r\n  - For your convenience, a [demo repo is available](https://github.com/Ashar2shahid/data-feed-reader-example-rsk-testnet),\r\n    which demonstrates how to do this.\r\n\r\nDo you have questions, comments, or clarifications?\r\nReach out to the reviewers on the [RSK community slack: developers.rsk.co/slack](https://developers.rsk.co/slack) in the `#bounties` channel;\r\nand on the [API3 discord: discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W](https://discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W) in the `#dev-support` channel.\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n- This bounty starts on 15/08/2022\r\n- This bounty accepts submissions until 15/09/2022\r\n",

If you're not familiar with this concept - there is a [dedicated page about that](https://wtfisqf.com/)\r\n\r\nWe at Everscale, have the [Ever DAO](https://everdao.net) tool for decision-making. For the distribution itself, we still use a simple multi-signature smart contract, which seems to be a limited solution, causing coordination overheads and raising the collusion issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Gitcoin DAO, there is a Grants platform, which solves these issues. It became a leading public funding tool for web3. Gitcoin DAO employs the Quadratic Funding mechanism for years to fund open-source projects.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to build a dApp that will implement the project matching and public funds distribution protocol based on individual token contributions. \r\n\r\nNote: the Sybil Resistance issue is out of the scope of this bounty, but we highly encourage you to elaborate on that topic\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Resources \r\n\r\nThe [Ever DAO](https://everdao.net) is a simple proposal/voting smart contract system, which is capable to execute custom logic upon a successful vote. The [OctusBridge](https://octusbridge.io) DAO uses the same contracts to operate the OctusBridge configurations and manage its treasury.\r\n\r\nSee how [Ever DAO (OctusBridge DAO) contracts](https://github.com/broxus/octusbridge-contracts) are implemented and [connected to the web-based dApp](https://github.com/broxus/octusbridge-frontend)",

A highly composable system provides recombinant components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.\r\n\r\nComposability means that elements can be put together in a variety of ways, and still work. It gives the creator flexibility to create something that operates in a new way or a new order. \r\n\r\n## Examples of composable building blocks in the Everscale ecosystem\r\n\r\n* [DexPair](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/DexPair.sol) and [StablePair](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/DexAccount.sol)\r\n* [Token Factory](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts/blob/master/contracts/TokenFactory.sol)\r\n* FlatQube Dex [DAO & Farming Contracts](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-dao-contracts)\r\n\r\nIn this bounty, we invite you to build a smart contract system that executes a pipeline of simple interactions with existing building blocks. As an example, below we provide a list of ideas that can use a [FlatQube](https://flatqube.io) DEX smart contracts as building blocks. \r\n\r\nNote, that you can pick any products from the Everscale ecosystem as building blocks. We suggest you build around DEX because it's the easiest way to create something actually helpful. \r\n\r\nThe quality of smart contracts would be the main judging criterion for this bounty. However, we encourage you to build at least a simple frontend dApp for the demo.\r\n\r\n# Ideas\r\n\r\n### Strategy builder\r\nCreate a \"Strategy builder\" dApp, which allows users to configure and deploy a smart contract. The app should allow the execution of the following pipelines. \r\n\r\n- receive token + swap a preconfigured portion of them + optionally send to preconfigured recipient address\r\n- receive token + swap to multiple tokens according to configuration + rebalancing logic + withdraw method\r\n- receive token + swap in 50/50 proportion + provide liquidity to pool + receive LP + lock LP into farming pool + claim rewards method with optional recipient address\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to connect one pipeline to another.\r\n\r\n### Gasless wallet\r\n- Wallet with logic for maintaining preconfigured gas balance\r\n- Each transfer implicitly triggers an additional transfer of tokens to the Gas Giver contract \r\n- The Gas Giver contract should periodically swap collected tokens to EVERs to maintain its balance\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a GitHub repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo, and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made.  \r\n\r\nThe project **submission deadline is Nov 28th**.\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\n\r\n* IMPACT & USEFULNESS: How impactful and useful the submission is in the Everscale ecosystem as a whole \r\n* ORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION: How new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies \r\n* MASS USABILITY: How feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations \r\n* TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY: What is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission \r\n* CLARITY: How clear or easily understood the documentation, examples, and pitch video is \r\n* TEAM DIVERSITY: How diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nDecember, the 7th, 2022\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [FlatQube DEX](https://flatqube.io) ([contracts source code](https://github.com/broxus/flatqube-contracts))\r\n- [Yield optimizer around FlatQube farm pools](https://github.com/Black-INK-finance/contracts)\r\n- [Tutorial for advanced onchain token management](https://tip3-onboarding.gitbook.io/)\r\n\r\n## Join the Everscale Dev Community\r\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/everscale)\r\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/EverscaleSmartContracts)\r\n\r\n## Onboarding samples and stuff\r\n\r\n#### Everscale general concepts\r\n* [Terminology](https://docs.everscale.network/learn/terminology)\r\n* [Architecture](https://docs.everscale.network/arch)\r\n\r\n#### Solidity\r\nEverscale Solidity compiler implementation is a bit different from the original EVM compiler.\r\n\r\n* [Everscale Solidity data structures, instructions, and keywords (full reference)](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler/blob/master/API.md)\r\n* [Framework for setting up smart-contract development environment](https://github.com/broxus/locklift)\r\n\r\n#### FT\r\n\r\n* Reference implementation: https://github.com/broxus/tip3\r\n* Standard: https://docs.everscale.network/standard/TIP-3.2\r\n",

The exact amount of each bounty for utilities will be decided at the discretion of the Ylide core team.\r\n\r\nAll prizes can be paid in native EVER tokens, as well as in WEVER (ERC20) on Binance, Polygon, or Ethereum. \r\n\r\n# Challenge description\r\nWe have allocated an additional prize pool for useful mini-products and utilities that can be embedded into other projects of the Ylide ecosystem. We do not limit your creativity but list some ideas below\r\n\r\n# Ideas\r\n* **List of all token holders registered in Ylide**: service, that generates the list of addresses registered in Ylide Registry smart contracts by particular token (fungible or non-fungible).\r\n* **Server-side-messaging**: make a backend micro-project that can send messages via Ylide (Everscale and Ethereum). The changes that need to be made to the SDK can be published directly as pull requests on Ylide Github.\r\n* **Event as a format:** create the \u201cevent\u201d message format - it should be displayed in the mailbox in a special way (name, date, time, participants), and the recipient can add it to the calendar (via .ics, for example).\r\n* **Fancy QR-code generator for Ylide Mail:** make a cute QR-code business card generator ([example card](https://knowtechie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/knowtechie-instagram-qr-code.jpg)) but with the Ylide address. When it is scanned the Ylide Mail is opened with an option to add the respective address to the contacts list or compose a mail directly (you need a mini-tool to generate a nice QR + pull request additional functionality in our mailbox repo).\r\n* **Ylide browser extension:** make a browser extension that draws the \"Write to Ylide\" icon next to all Everscale/Ethereum addresses (provided that the address is registered in Ylide)\r\n\r\n# Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a GitHub repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo, a link to the live dApp (if any), and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on the progress made.\r\n\r\nThe project\u00a0**submission deadline is Nov 28th.**\r\n\r\n# Judging Criteria\r\n* **Potential Impact:** How big of an impact could the project have?\r\n* **User Experience & Design:** Does the design of the project make the user experience easy?\r\n* **Implementation of the idea:** Does the end result demonstrate quality software development and design?\r\n* **Usage of Ylide\u2019s tools:** To what extent are the available standards and tools of Ylide leveraged?\r\n\r\n# Winner Announcement Date\r\nWe will review all submissions very quickly after the end of the hackathon (23:59 UTC 28 Nov) and announce the winners along with the other track owners.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n* [Ylide Website](https://ylide.io/)\r\n* [Qamon Website](https://qamon.io/)\r\n* [Docs](https://docs.ylide.io/)\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/ylide-io)\r\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/XfKfKhbvHS)\r\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/ylide_chat)\r\n* [Telegram DM](https://t.me/ignat_ylide)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Sales data show that these in-game stats dominate above all else when it comes to valuing a pirate, with combat and constitution being the two most important stats. PIRATEs have been sold anywhere from 1-1,000 Algo. With over 15,000 PIRATEs in circulation and hundreds of pirates listed and sold it can be difficult for buyers and sellers, especially newcomers, to know what the fair value of a pirate is. We need a similarity service that accepts a single NFT and returns similar NFTs that have been recently valued by others (active listings or recent sales) based on weighted property data.\r\nThe service has several interesting challenges:\r\n* Pirates always change Pirate stats go up and down as pirates level-up, fight, die, and are revived. Keeping track of changing pirate data is important. New pirates are also minted daily so it\u2019s an ever evolving dataset. Some NFT collections don\u2019t change but we expect lots of gaming NFTs and future ARC19 NFTs to have high mutability.\r\n* Tracking current listings and sales - Data is all available via web3 to do it from the blockchain or you can use provided web2 APIs to get this data (see resources section for details).\r\n* Listings vs Sales - A similar pirate that Active listings and sales can both be used for finding similarities. For example the service can find: this NFT is similar to NFT \u201cA\u201d that was sold ~3 days ago for X Algo, and is also similar to NFT \u201cB\u201d that is currently listed for Y Algo.\r\n* Weighted Property Data - How does the service decide which properties are most meaningful? You can come up with your own heuristic or you could analyze bulk sales data to try and compute weights.\r\n\r\nAll of the data needed for this challenge re tracking NFTs, listings, and sales is available via web3 or one can use the AlgoSeas APIs to get this data (see Resources section for details) \r\n\r\nThe challenge is open-ended but the service should effectively answer this question: \u201cGiven an NFT what are the closest N active listings and what are the closest N recent sales for this NFT?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt minimum the response needs to contain the asset IDs that are most similar but it could also provide other data like the algo amount, date it occurred, whether it is a listing or a sale, a \u201csimilarity score\u201d (how close your service thinks these two NFTs are to each other), etc.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, and a recorded demo, working CLI, or live API that can be called (for determining the latency criteria).\r\nWe prefer the service to be written in TypeScript but will accept solutions in JavaScript or Python. This service will be folded into the AlgoSeas platform and maintained by the development team. We do not expect any frontend development for the challenge but if you want to build anything for demo purposes and to be usable by the team we prefer React.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made\r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a community vote that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November The community vote will primarily be for voting on NFT similarity and will be hosted in the AlgoSeas Discord.\r\nTwo representatives from AlgoSeas and two other judges (by invitation) will also assess each project submission by  17:00 EST on Monday the 14th of November. The following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\n#### FUNCTIONAL\r\nDoes it work when run against any pirate AssetID? Are the similar results provided reasonable? How do your results for a specific assetID compare to those of other submissions? Does it work when Pirate metadata is updated or when new Pirates are minted?\r\n#### LATENCY\r\nHow long does it take to get results from your service? Latency will be determined by running a series of requests and taking the p90 latency.\r\n#### EXTENSIBILITY\r\nHow generic is your solution, could it be easily applied to other NFT collections? Some examples of collections that it can be applied to include \u201cAlvatars: Tile Fighters\u201d or Alchemon.\r\n#### WOW FACTOR\r\nHackers always do surprising things. Thought of something that would be really cool to have that isn\u2019t listed here? Go for it and you can earn bonus points from this category!\r\n### Terms\r\nAll submitted code will be considered usable by the AlgoSeas team, regardless of whether or not the participants are chosen to receive a prize bounty. Additionally, refer to the Participation Agreement for full details.\r\nWinner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter. Ecosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\nResources\r\nAlgoSeas IndexerAPI - https://algoexplorer.io/api-dev/indexer-v2\r\nAlgoSeas Discord - https://discord.gg/HKQAGXKJc3\r\nAlgoSeas Discord Sales Channel - https://discord.gg/pf898W2U2j\r\n[Pirate NFT Creator address (NEX7N2...)](https://algoexplorer.io/address/NEX7N2U36UHBTRHJA4T3WEOOGYMPXL56ICNO4CCJAJBYFJSA7PZJU33H7U)\r\n[AlgoSeas Marketplace address (7SSZH\u2026)](https://algoexplorer.io/address/7SSZHWXNWMY3AV6HV5PTF3R2BPH67BMQPCCXWYQWUPHUKE6E4PA5QUOQSU)\r\nhttps://algoseas.io/marketplace\r\nhttps://algoseas.io/marketplace/collection/AlgoSeas%20Pirates \r\n#### GET Active Pirate Listings API\r\n[https://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/listings?type=listing&sortBy=price&sortAscending=true&collectionName=AlgoSeas Pirates&limit=500](https://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/listings?type=listing&sortBy=price&sortAscending=true&collectionName=AlgoSeas) \r\n#### GET Recent Pirate Sales API\r\nhttps://d3ohz23ah7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace/sales?collectionName=AlgoSeas%20Pirates&sortBy=time&sortAscending=false&limit=500\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate",

Except our Next.ID's DID bindings, we are also fetching the identity relation from different data sources like `rss3`, `keybase` and `knn3`. \r\n\r\n`relation_server` fetch data from [Upstream](https://docs.next.id/relation-service/rs-intro#upstreams)s\r\nWhen performing a data fetching process, RelationService will\r\n\r\n- Iter all available upstreams which can handle this query\r\n- Request and collect results from each upstream available\r\n- Newly fetched data will be fed into this circulation again, until no new data is yield.\r\n\r\nTo better understand how it will be processed, you could also check [Web5.bio](https://twitter.com/HominLuo/status/1574448473637724161). We are aiming to bring the identity graph to the social graph next year. To better support this goal, we need more data sources to be available in `relation_server`. \r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- Understand how does [GraphQL](https://docs.next.id/relation-service/rs-graphql) work. We need you to clean up and match the data structure we currently supported. About how does `relation_server` currently run, the actual code can be found at [src/upstream/mod.rs](https://github.com/nextdotid/relation_server/blob/develop/src/upstream/mod.rs) -> pub async fn fetch_all() definition. \r\n- The new data source you want to work on should not be our current-supported one. \r\n[ProofService](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-intro)\r\n[Keybase](https://keybase.io/)\r\n[SybilList](https://github.com/Uniswap/sybil-list/blob/master/verified.json)\r\n[RSS3](https://rss3.io/network/api.html)\r\n[KNN3](https://docs.knn3.xyz/graphql)\r\n[CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.me/)\r\nETH Leaderboard\r\nTheGraph for\r\n[ENS](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ensdomains/ens)\r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $2000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) before starting your hacking.

For now, `proof_server` performs `proof_post` fetching by API or single HTTP GET. \r\n\r\n`proof_server` is designed to prove \"An [Identity](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-identity) and an [Avatar](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-avatar) is held by the same person\".\r\n\r\nLet's take this assertion into 2 parts:\r\n\r\n\"I\" hold this Avatar.\r\n\"I\" hold this identity.\r\n1 equals \"Generate a signature using secret key of this Avatar\".\r\n\r\n2 equals \"Make an action using this identity\".\r\n\r\nHere we reach 1 and 2 with [Proof Post](https://docs.next.id/proof-service/ps-glossary#glossary-proof-post) mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo make `proof_server` supports more and more services, we want our community endorsers to help us bring platforms like `facebook`, `xbox`, `instagram` etc. to be available on `proof_server`. \r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- The new platform should be able to let users themselves to using `proof_post` prove their identity. \r\n- The new platform should be a new platform that `proof_server` is not available now. Please check our current supported [Platform List](https://docs.next.id/rest-api/platforms). \r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $1000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) to understand our mechanism before starting your hacking. You will need to **create a pr** to this repo to submit your work.\r\n\r\n## Contact Info\r\n\r\n@hominluo @nykma here or Telegram for any question regarding how to work on Next.ID.",

But in real world, there may be no way for some `platform`s to do this way. Including:\r\n\r\n- No APIs at all provided by `platform`\r\n- API needs each user to do an `OAuth` to fetch their own data\r\n- API has very strict quota and will finally exceed if `proof_service` users grows.\r\n- User data cannot be fetched by single `HTTP GET` (e.g. JavaScript-driven `XHR` is performed in that page)\r\n- HTML DOM struct is changed frequently, can't define a fixed selector to query the data from DOM tree.\r\n- Remote HTTP server has a strict anti-bot mechanism, single `HTTP GET` will be blocked in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nTo make `proof_server` supports more and more services later, we need a headless browser to simulate normal user's page-browsing flow.\r\n\r\n## Design goal\r\n\r\n- The headless browser module can be kind of independent from current `proof_server`'s code structure. With a simple wrapper, `proof_server` can communicate with it in different processes.\r\n- The headless browser module will find user's proof post using single `regexp`, instead of parsing and `css-style` selecting DOM.\r\n\r\n## Winner Info\r\n\r\nWe will select up to **2** winners and each will receive at least $3000 as the winning prize.\r\n\r\n## Submission Info\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you read through our [docs](https://docs.next.id/) before starting your hacking.

In web 2 we have established patterns for event architecture and publisher / subscriber model. For example all the consumers can listen to a source of an event and all the subscribers are notified when a certain even happens. In case of Algorand Blockchain, we have to poll the explorer to get status of events for example whether the transaction has been confirmed on chain, is the atomic swap has been completed or not. All the applications having this use case  are writing their own logic for popping the blockchain. We are looking to build a solution that will enable subscribing to events on the blockchain and all the subscribers will be notified in real time of the various events they subscribe to.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. \r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a quadratic community voting element to the judging process that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November. \r\nFour judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by Monday the 14th of November. \r\n\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\nIMPACT & USEFULNESS:\r\nHow impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole\r\nORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION:\r\nHow new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies\r\nMASS USABILITY:\r\nHow feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations\r\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:\r\nWhat is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission\r\nCLARITY:\r\nHow clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is\r\nTEAM DIVERSITY:\r\nHow diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.\r\nEcosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\n### Resources\r\nDeveloper.algorand.org\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/\r\nhttps://github.com/algorand-devrel\r\nAlgorand Discord - https://discord.gg/Algorand\r\n\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate\r\n",

Content, products, and data will be created and owned by users.\r\n\r\nThis challenge is to explore connecting GameFi to the real world's productivity. How does GameFi incentivize its creators? How does GameFi combine the sales and application of robo-vehicle in the real world? How to combine it with the governance of a DAO? Most importantly, this challenge should avoid taking the game out of its essence and becoming a Ponzi scheme.\r\n\r\nPlease facilitate participants in the Game Design Planning challenge to elaborate on why this game could bring great fun to its players and connect to the real world's productivity.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission needs to include the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u25cf Provide a new token model and numerical settings for your chosen robo-vehicle (NEV) customization game design plan.  \r\n\u25cf Design a token distribution mechanism for it, and must combine it with the Creator Economy.  \r\n\u25cf Design a GameFi model that can combine with the governance of DAO.  \r\n\u25cf You can continue to optimize your proposal by getting feedback from other participants/challenges.  \r\n\u25cf The final submission is one PDF format document (1920 \u00d7 1080p, 16:9) with some infographics. We only accept the original projects, it cannot be anything you have done before this Hackathon.  \r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nPanel assessment on the project's innovation and feasibility.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nNov 7th\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nKeep up with announcements about this challenge \ud83d\udc49[Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/Ge3U7BfjxC)  \r\nCheck the Game Design Planning challenge\u2019s output \ud83d\udc49 [Issue 1](https://github.com/DeAutoDAO/Hackathon_-I-Game-Robot/issues/1)  \r\nMeet other participants \ud83d\udc49 [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/CHdW29G3Ee)  \r\nRead this article to understand why and how to achieve democratic innovation of robo-vehicle manufacturing \ud83d\udc49[Medium](https://medium.com/@nancylee007)  \r\nKnow more about DeAuto\u2019s ultimate vision \ud83d\udc49 [Official Website](https://www.deauto.io/)  ",

Maximum 20 teams will be awarded.)\r\n\r\n*All prizes will be paid out in FIL and outside of Gitcoin.\r\n\r\n**### Challenge Description**\r\n\r\nProjects that use [IPFS](http://docs.ipfs.io/) for content-addressing and/or [Filecoin](http://docs.filecoin.io/) for decentralized, persistent storage. (Submissions that use either technology indirectly via [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/), [Libp2p,](https://libp2p.io/) or other tooling also qualify). All types of projects are welcome and we welcome your creativity. Feel free to browse past winners [here](https://hackathons.filecoin.io/#hall-of-fame) for inspiration.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nAt a minimum submissions for prizes should include the following items:\r\n\r\n**1. Project Description**\r\n- The name and summary of the project\r\n- Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact info (e.g., GitHub handle, email address, or other)\r\n- How the project uses IPFS and/or Filecoin and/or decentralized storage services that build on top of either with example links to where in code those technologies are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Link to the publicly visible source code repository**\r\n- Provide comprehensive README, incl. a clear description of the work and mention of how our tech is used in the Technologies Used section of README.\r\n- Include a link to the working demo or provide a testing guide\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Showcase**\r\n- 2-3 minute video that presents the idea, including a brief demo that demonstrates the use of IPFS and/or Filecoin or anything that builds on top of them\r\n- If applicable, select the appropriate track when submitting the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\nOnly submit what you have built specifically for this hackathon. Submitting a project previously submitted to any other of our hackathons will lead to disqualification\r\nOnly projects or features (preferably in separate branch) built specifically for the respective hackathon will be considered for prizes\r\nBroken links may disqualify the project from the judging process.\r\nUsing an IPFS HTTP gateway doesn\u2019t count as building on top of IPFS. Exclusively basing your submission on that does not make you eligible for prizes.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nOur judges grade submissions across five equally-weighted categories: 1) Design, 2) Novelty/Originality, 3) Technical Accomplishment, 4) Potential Impact, 5) Creativity/Fun. Submissions will be rated with decimal numbers between 0 (worst) - 5 (best) per category (max score: 25). The final score is the average of all voting judges. If a project scores low, we reserve the right not to award prizes, even if it was the only project submitted to a given track.\r\n\r\n- \ud83e\udd29\u00a0**Novelty/Creativity:** Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way? Does it solve a new problem? Is it creative and puts a smile on people\u2019s faces?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83d\ude80 Potential Impact:** Does it fill a gap in the universe, and have the potential to be used frequently by a large, growing and diverse audience or market? Is it\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\udd16 Technical Accomplishment:** Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete?\r\n\r\n- **\ud83e\ude84\u00a0Filecoin & IPFS Implementation:** Does the project interact with IPFS/Filecoin under-the-hood (i.e., more than simply retrieving a CID from a gateway)? Does it use NFT.storage, web3.storage, or other storage helpers? Does it deploy a solidity smart contract to Filecoin Virtual Machine to compute over the stored data?\r\n\r\n- **\u2728Design:** How is the UX/UI/DX? Is it easy to use? If targeting developers, is the experience smooth and intuitive? Does the visual design delight you?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny winners will be notified after the event is over with specific instructions (including but not limited to filling out the necessary tax information) on how to claim their prize. Failure to provide the appropriate information within the timeframe specified in the winner notification message could mean delayed payment or claim rejection.\r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nWinners will be announced after the end of the 2022 Gitcoin Social Hour.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [Additional information on eligibility criteria](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82)\r\n- [Getting Started with IPFS & Filecoin](https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Getting-Started-With-IPFS-Filecoin-c00526cf97ba4087ba5c3ad5f5337a58)\r\n- [IPFS & Filecoin Discord](https://discord.gg/Ymp3XZPH9V)\r\n- [Community Office Hours](https://bitly.protocol.ai/Community-Office-Hours)\r\n- [30-minute introduction on how to build with IPFS & Filecoin](https://youtu.be/5-0_DqXGY-M)",

This change would allow us to build another apps with exactly the same indexing functionality as in Navigator and also to improve it for all apps at the same time.\r\n\r\nRoom DB must be used only for keeping list of folders after solving this task. Index will be kept in memory of `arklib` process. We should guarantee that `arklib` is not killed as long as app instance lives. Even better if we can keep it live longer than the app, so if we restarted the app we would not recalculate the index. If this is not possible, we will need to create persistence of index (cache), see https://github.com/ARK-Builders/ARK-Navigator/issues/142 and https://github.com/ARK-Builders/arklib/issues/15 for more details.",

The decentralized app should reward existing customers with an application token when a specific action is taken or some time in membership has elapsed. The exact conditions are not specified but could be for recruiting new members to an organization, a website, or discord channel. Members may be rewarded for performing specific operations like answering questions for new users or being in an organization for a certain length of time. The application should support adding or modifying reward conditions and amounts. These conditions should be implemented in smart contracts and triggered by using one of the Algorand SDKs. The loyalty token should be redeemable for additional member benefits like additional privileges or exchangeable for merchandise at a given level. \r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nA valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works.\r\nIt is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. \r\nThe project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on Wednesday the 2nd of November. \r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThere will be a quadratic community voting element to the judging process that will commence shortly after the project submission deadline; this will close at 17:00 EST on Monday the 7th of November. \r\nFour judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by Monday the 14th of November. \r\n\r\nThe following criteria will be used to assess projects:\r\nIMPACT & USEFULNESS:\r\nHow impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole\r\nORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY & INNOVATION:\r\nHow new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies\r\nMASS USABILITY:\r\nHow feasible is the idea & how adaptable is it across other integrations\r\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:\r\nWhat is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission\r\nCLARITY:\r\nHow clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is\r\nTEAM DIVERSITY:\r\nHow diverse are the team\u2019s skill sets & what is the quality of the team formation\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be announced on Sunday the 20th of November, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.\r\nEcosystem Funding may be issued at the discretion of the Algorand Foundation to retrospectively advance high potential projects.\r\n### Resources\r\nDeveloper.algorand.org\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/\r\nhttps://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/\r\nhttps://github.com/algorand-devrel\r\nAlgorand Discord - https://discord.gg/Algorand\r\n\r\n### Difficulty: Intermediate\r\n",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "## Description\r\nCreate an Agoric governance component using a new ElectionType that instantiates a public vote to give voting facets to the election winners. There should be a public registration of the identities of the candidates to make them visible.\r\n\r\nThis bounty focuses on creating the committee that will be elected and includes a charter to control the manner of their election and operation. Our existing committee is elected only once, and the membership can't be updated. The biggest open issues are refreshing the membership, and controlling the ability to create new votes.\r\n\r\nPossible approaches to membership include replacing members who have become unresponsive, scheduling periodic elections, or supporting recalls. There are several plausible ways to limit the ability to open new questions: a chair or subcommittee, require approval from some subset of the members, or requiring a payment or deposit.\r\n\r\nThis bounty shouldn't include any work on those who vote to elect this committee. Internally, those processes are currently under review.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nCurrently, voters only get a voting facet via an invitation. The electors vote to choose a committee, and the committee members then get the ability to vote. The voters can reliably identify the Electorate by subscribing to get a list of new questions. Voters can use the questionHandle from each update from the subscription to get the questionDetails. They cast their vote by sending their selected position(s) to their electorate, which they know and trust.\r\n\r\nWe want everyone to be able to identify the candidates and winners. Anyone who knows the electorate can get a list of questions, so this includes both the original electorate and the elected committee members for the original election, and then the committee itself will be well-known, and so both the public and the committee members can find out what questions the committee is voting on.\r\n\r\nThis structure of Electorates and VoteCounters allows voters and observers to verify how votes will be counted, and who can vote on them, but doesn't constrain the process of creating questions. We now have a PSMCharter and EconCommittee Charter, that control aspects of creating questions that those committees can vote on. A charter or electionManager can control the voting threshold, the vote closing time, or the range of parameter values that can be specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nA successful bounty will:\r\n* Complete the requirements from the description including reasonable edge cases not explicitly defined\r\n* Pass code review from Agoric team\r\n* Include documented open source code and walkthrough presentation\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\nAbout One Week\r\n\r\n## Reward\r\n$3200\r\n\r\nPayment will be made in USD (fiat currency) via wire transfer. The developer is responsible for providing their completed tax documents (W9 for US based developers and/or W8 or W8-BEN-E for non-US based developers) and providing their banking details in order to receive payment. \r\n\r\n## Applicant Assessment Criteria\r\nImportant: Please provide a clear work plan for how you will approach this bounty.  Use the work plan as an initial demonstration that you would be a good candidate.  Bounties will require coordination with the Agoric team, so unfortunately only plans submitted in English will be considered.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n* Issue-specific domain experience\r\n* Issue-specific technical capability\r\n* Familiarity with Agoric's platform\r\n* JavaScript experience\r\n* Availability and communication\r\n\r\n## Experience Write-up (1000-1500 words)\r\nAs part of completing the bounty, we ask that you write up a short summary of your experience building on Agoric. Write-up should include:\r\n* Begin with a compelling, relevant introductory hook statement (<50 words). \r\n* Clearly explain the specific bounty project (~100 words). \r\n* Describe how the developer approached the problem (~300 words). \r\n* Give a step-by-step description of the solution (>500 words && <1000 words).\r\n* At least three code snippets per write-up. They do not count toward overall word count. \r\n* Conclude with clear calls to action on developing with Agoric - specifically how any ambition developer reading this piece could do more themselves (>150 words). \r\n\r\nThis is important feedback for us as we evolve the platform.\r\n\r\n## Review Process\r\n* Agoric team reviews your submitted work plan on Gitcoin.\r\n* It is best to join our Discord and post your Gitcoin name in the bounties channel, so that we can follow up with you. Otherwise, we will write on your Gitcoin profile wall and say hello!\r\n* Agoric contacts you to provide reference projects / sample code for engineering review.\r\n* Introductory call to discuss your plans and expected timeline.\r\n* Join the Agoric Discord bounties channel (if you haven\u2019t done so already).\r\n* Agoric accepts you on Gitcoin and you get started!\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Agoric Documentation](https://docs.agoric.com/)\r\n* [Agoric Governance Doc](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/governance)\r\n* [#bounties channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/854426485900967988) for general questions and your private bounty channel for direct questions to the Agoric team",

Fairdrive, a personal data store, is looking to support such a dApp which would allow its users to access their stored data to generate NFTs. Leveraging the provided library, the goal is to correctly connect the metadata of the content and the image.\r\n\r\nAs a User, I would like an NFT Generator dApp connected to Fairdrive that allows me to select an image and mint as NFT in xDai saved to Swarm, so that I can expand on the value of my data stored in Fairdrive. \r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n\r\n- Familiarize with the repo containing Fairdrive: https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp\r\n- Familiarize yourself with the SwarmNFT.js: https://github.com/igar1991/SwarmNFT\r\n- Create Repo on Github that contains code\r\n- Create Generator dApp that follows the process below:\r\n    - Open the NFT Generator dApp\r\n    - Connect to Fairdrive\r\n    - Select a folder of images in Fairdrive\r\n    - Select a specific a specific image\r\n    - Use selected image to Generate an NFT\r\n    - NFT to be minted on xDai\r\n    - Newly minted NFT to be stored to Swarm\r\n\r\n\r\n**Approving criteria**\r\n\r\n- A new public repo is opened with open source code and a link to the repo is in the Gitcoin issue. \r\n- Include Readme file with instructions on how to use the app\r\n- Use open source license Apache 2.0\r\n- User's have the ability to open an NFT Generator, connected to Fairdrive that allows them to select an image to mint as NFT in xDai saved to Swarm.\r\n-\r\n\r\n**Timeline**\r\n\r\n- Due 15th Feb 2022\r\n\r\nUse the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KrVTmahcUA) for more information and support.\r\n\r\nMind the [Fair Data Society Principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/) in your tasks.",

It enables us to more easily navigate the world around us and find places of interest.\r\n- Maintaining relevant maps on a global scale is a massive effort that just a few (commercial) providers are able to tackle to an appropriate degree - thereby only a couple of large players are present. Providing maps and services on top of them gives them a competitive edge and certain power over the market of all the services connected to them.\r\n- Project Galileo builds on top of FairOS which uses Swarm\u2019s decentralized storage. It is tackling two aspects that are crucial to solving the above problems: how can decentralized storage and tech be used to host the geodata and how can communities be engaged to contribute and be properly compensated for the contributions.\r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n- Familiarize with the repo containing Galileo : https://github.com/fairDataSociety/galileo\r\n- Familiarize yourself with the rendered content on the Galileo webpage: https://app.galileo.fairdatasociety.org/  \r\n- Follow the instructions in the Galileo repo (https://github.com/fairDataSociety/galileo#readme ) on \"How to create and share your own map?\"\r\n- Use the instructions to contribute the **map of Kenya**; take notes where instructions might be improved   \r\n\r\n**Approving criteria**\r\n- Map of **Kenya** is visible on the Galileo webpage\r\n- Feedback on instructions is given, with possible improvements noted (something between 250 -500 words)\r\n\r\n**Timeline**\r\n- Deadline: 15th Feb 2022\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n[Swarm documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/).\r\n[FairOS documentation](https://docs.fairos.fairdatasociety.org/docs/).\r\nUse the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.gg/KrVTmahcUA) for more information and support.\r\nMind the [Fair Data Society Principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/) in your tasks.",

Then read on!\r\n\r\n**Want to create a product on the platform? Here\u2019s some things to think about:**\r\n\r\nAt Reserve, we see our new protocol as a platform for people to launch products and even businesses on. So go ahead, build and pitch your product idea. Come up with a clever, catchy brand. Figure out the economics for how this can be sustainable for this system, and maybe even for you as a builder. Build new collateral plugins or leverage existing one. Fork the [Register.app](https://register.app/) repo and create a custom website and interface to mint it, redeem it, and stake/unstake RSR.\r\n\r\nShould there be a flywheel that builds up treasury tokens for increased voting power in defi? Should it instead fund marketing operations? How much AUM and revenue is needed to do that?\r\n\r\nWhat is the \u201crisk / reward\u201d profile of this token? Is it high yield, high risk? Low yield, low risk? Something else? Do the collateral plugins exist? Do they need to be written?\r\n\r\nThis is for you to decide and invent. Feel free to leverage any and all content we\u2019ve created for inspiration or just use your team\u2019s own \ud83e\udde0.\r\n\r\n**Want to create a tool for the ecosystem? Here\u2019s some things to think about:**\r\n\r\nThere are two main constituents in our ecosystem: 1) governors / stakers and 2) RToken holders. These groups have some similar, but many different needs and potential pain points. \r\n\r\nThere are also other smaller but no less critical roles in the ecosystem: Gaurdians, Pausers, \u201ceconomic designers\u201d. Economic designers might need to know more than a typical yield-farmer: other risk factors, how those interplay and overlap with other types of collateral, etc. Pausers and Gaurdians need to be on-call with varying SLAs and be able to make fairly quick decisions based on data that is not at their fingertips.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\n- Links to implementation repositories (github, gitlab, etc). Include in that repository:\r\n    - Project description\r\n    - Links to live project, if applicable (recommended)\r\n- Demo Video\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria for your Creation\r\n\r\nOur single overriding criterion for judging submissions is the importance of your project to the overall Reserve ecosystem, as determined by the Reserve judges.\r\n\r\nThe bigger this thing could make the overall ecosystem, the more excited we will be about it. \u201cImportance\u201d is admittedly vague, but is composed mostly of the following subcriteria:\r\n\r\n- Completeness of project.\r\n- Anticipated usefulness of project (i.e. viability for a product).\r\n- Safety of project to all constituents.\r\n- Quality of project (code, design, economics).\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

                "body": "### Prize Title\r\nCollateral Plugin\r\n\u200b\r\n### Prize Bounty\r\n- $140k total for [this category across all plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzO9BYE-xYe4JOdrarrNAlUgyaG6QFc3tb9PIFnb3VA/).\r\n- Amount for this particular plugin is in the title. You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\u200b\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\u200b\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\u200b\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\u200b\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\u200b\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\u200b\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\u200b\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\u200b\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n- Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nIf we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\nThe degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\u200b\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\u200b\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\u200b\r\n### Resources\r\n\u200b\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

You have a choice of RSR, USDC, or DAI.\r\n- We have listed $120k of bounties in this category and will be awarding the extra $20k to the best submissions across the category, as determined by the judging criteria.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\n\r\nOur protocol is a platform that allows anyone to permissionlessly define an asset-backed currency. These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n>\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon (December 22, 2022).\r\n\r\nTo accept the prize, winners will need to complete and sign one of the following on Docusign:\r\n- W-9 (for US citizen/resident or company)\r\n- W-8BEN (for non-US person)\r\n- W-8BEN-E (for non-US company/entity)\r\n\r\nWe are quite secure in how we collect KYC information and will never share PII with anyone outside of necessary tax authorities.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/)",

If a similar tutorial or solution already exists on the Developer Portal, how is this different and important?\r\n- Relevance - Is the topic particularly relevant to the developer community given current market trends and community needs?\r\n- Complexity - How complex was the problem you were trying to solve? Was the solution to the complex problem simple and elegant?\r\n- Community Feedback - Is your topic supported and audited by the community? How many stars did the Github repo receive?\r\n- Utility/Value - How much value will this bring to the Algorand developer community? Does it help solve a problem that many developers have? Does it provide depth to a topic that doesn't yet exist for a certain domain?\r\n- Code Quality - Is the code and repository well-organized and documented? Does it adhere to language-specific style guidelines?\r\n- Writing Quality - Is the writing clear and informative for a developer audience? Is it free from grammar mistakes and typos?\r\n- Scope of Work - How much time and effort did it take to complete this project?\r\n- **Extra Media - Does the submission include images, screenshots, and/or videos?**\r\n\r\n# Submission Procedure\r\nSubmit your blog post following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Submit your completed Github Repository to Gitcoin\r\n2. Sign Up or Log In onto the Algorand Developer Portal.\r\n3. Create a new publication, of type \"Tutorial\" on the Algorand Developer Portal.\r\n4. Draft your publication and \"Submit for Review\".\r\n5. Provide your Gitcoin bounty project page link in the comment section of the submitted draft page. \r\n6. Work with the Dev Rel team to edit and finalize the submission.\r\n7. **For more synchronized communication, provide a discord username in the comment section.**\r\n\r\n# Other Requirements\r\n\r\n- For questions, reach out to Algorand on [Discord](https://discord.gg/84AActu3at).\r\n- Taking this bounty task means you have agreed to our Bounty Agreement terms and policies.\r\n- All project codes should be published on GitHub, with MIT license or Apache V2 license.\r\n- All contributions/PRs to public (Algorand) repositories should be open source and should follow the contributions rules of the relevant repository.\r\n- All non-codes documents should be using Markdown format.\r\n- In the project description or repository readme, there should be a proper security notice. E.g., it should tell the visitor the project is not audited and should not be used in a production environment.\r\n- You are not eligible to receive additional rewards through other Algorand programs like the developer ambassadors program.\r\n",

These currencies can be more creative, and potentially more successful, if there are more building blocks from which to choose.\r\n\r\nAn important goal of this hackathon is to create as many safe, usable collateral plugins as possible to cover the entirety of possibilities in the defi landscape. We sourced this list from Defillama and our research.\r\n\r\nWrite a collateral plugin, or collection of plugins, for the defi protocol specified in the title, so that people can use collateral from the protocol as collateral in an RToken.\r\n\r\n**### Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\nThe submitted repository must include:\r\n\r\n- Source code for your Collateral plugin or plugins\r\n- An open source license\r\n- Documentation (e.g, a README file), describing the following for each plugin:\r\n    - What are the collateral token, reference unit, and target unit for this plugin?\r\n    - How does one configure and deploy an instance of the plugin?\r\n        - If the deployer should plug in price feeds, what units does your plugin expect those price feeds to be stated in?\r\n    - Why should the value (reference units per collateral token) decrease only in exceptional circumstances?\r\n    - How does the plugin guarantee that its `status()` becomes `DISABLED` in those circumstances?\r\n- A link to a demo video in which you do the following in an Ethereum mainnet fork:\r\n    - Deploy an RToken with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Mint RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n    - Allow token appreciation to occur, if applicable.\r\n    - Redeem RTokens with each collateral plugin in the basket.\r\n\r\n*Note: In the Additional Info field, specify the hash of the git commit that you want considered for this bounty. This will help us be sure of the order in which plugin submissions were completed.*\r\n\r\n** ### Acceptance Criteria **\r\n\r\nEach Collateral plugin must:\r\n\r\n- Fully implement the [ICollateral interface][icoll].\r\n- Satisfy the correctness properties given in the [Collateral plugin-writing howto](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md).\r\n- Be fully permissionless once deployed.\r\n- Be documented with cogent explanations of its economics.\r\n- Be deployable with USD as its [Unit of Account](https://reserve.org/protocol/monetary_units_baskets/#monetary-units).\r\n- Not be prone to relatively simple economic attacks or *cough cough* \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, static analysis with [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) over your whole codebase should not yield avoidable issues of moderate or greater severity. If some slither report is not sensibly avoidable, your documentation should note that, and explain either how we can see that the report is spurious, or that the problem it\u2019s reporting is unavoidable in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n**### Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple submissions in this category that meet all acceptance criteria, we will decide the grant winner based on the following judgments:\r\n\r\n- How clear, clean, and solidly-engineered is the implementation?\r\n- How gas-efficient is the implementation? The Reserve protocol makes heavy use of the `refresh()`, `price()`, and `status()` functions, for users\u2019 sake these need to be especially efficient.\r\n- How easy is it to reason about what these Collateral plugins do?\r\n- Do we see technical or economic vulnerabilities in these plugins, and how severe are they?\r\n- Could these plugins be deployed and used on mainnet immediately, or are they missing prerequisites? For instance, do they require price feeds or trading mechanisms that don\u2019t already exist?\r\n- How large is the range of significant, natural use cases covered by this set of Collateral plugins? Example of this further described below.\r\n\r\n> For an illustration of \u201crange of use cases,\u201d when we implemented our Compound collateral plugins, we thought it important to implement three different kinds of Collateral contracts to capture three substantially different kinds of Compound-wrapped tokens:\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is a fiatcoin, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cUSDC is redeemable for USDC, and the plugin should default if USDC loses its peg to USD.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token is pegged to some unstable asset, and the Collateral plugin should default if the underlying token\u2019s price diverges from the target unit\u2019s price. For instance, cWBTC has underlying token WBTC, and the plugin should default if WBTC loses its peg to BTC.\r\n> - Tokens where the underlying token simply *is* the target asset, and requires no default check. For instance, cETH has underlying token ETH, and so the underlying token itself needs no default check.\r\n> If we had implemented only one or two of these, the range of use cases would be notably smaller.\r\n> The degree to which each Collateral plugin is configurable will also contribute to the range of use cases covered by the set of plugins. Again, we expect the already-existing Collateral plugins should be a good guide here.\r\n> \r\n\r\n**### Winner Announcement Date**\r\n\r\nTwo weeks following the end of the hackathon.\r\n\r\n**### Resources**\r\n\r\n- [How to write a collateral plugin](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/collateral.md)\r\n- [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/jY9dGHKc)\r\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol)\r\n- [Documentation](https://reserve.org/protocol/) + Intro Video\r\n- How the Protocol Works Video",

The prize bounty will be split amongst the top 3 submissions with 1st place receiving $3,500, 2nd place receiving $1,000, and 3rd place receiving $500.\r\n\r\n### Challenge Description\r\nThis is a special Devcon themed challenge to build the best air gapped wallet asset verification experience. We want everyone to benefit from a more streamlined and simplified wallet asset verification process where the assets that need to be verified can only be accessed on a separate \u201cair gapped\u201d system. Both systems can be connected to a network, but the incentive should capture the ability to verify any wallet owned assets where that wallet does not want to be exposed to a broader network.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this challenge is to simply verify an offline high value wallet asset with an online mobile wallet or device. For example, imagine that you want to verify a high value NFT that lives in your Ledger or Trezor wallet to gain entry to an exclusive event, you prove ownership of the asset but not be required to bring your hardware wallet to the event and be required to connect and sign a message in a crowded public space. How could you perform the same verification with your mobile phone that still allows the event to assert your ownership of the asset?\r\n\r\n### Submission Requirements\r\nSubmissions must be a valid public GitHub repository containing the open source code for an air gapped wallet asset verification solution. All submissions must be received by October 28th, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST.\r\n\r\n### Judging Criteria\r\nThe prize pool will be split among valid submissions at the discretion of a panel of Shopify blockchain team judges. Scoring parameters include the UX, ingenuity/innovation, simplicity, and visual flair. There will be 10 points for UX, 5 each for all remaining parameters for a total of 25 points. \r\n\r\nYour submission must demonstrate the ability to verify one or more air gapped wallet assets such as NFTs and other tokens, as well as verify any quantities or attributes defined by those tokens.\r\n\r\n### Winner Announcement Date\r\nWinners will be notified by November 4th, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST. Prize payouts will be completed by November 10, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST. \r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThis challenge is being sponsored by the blockchain team at Shopify. We want to engage the community and create a challenge opportunity for teams to create a fun and exciting product that will benefit the Ethereum community as a whole. The winners of the challenge will receive a monetary prize and the notoriety that comes with building something amazing that people want to use in their projects. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to blockchain-challenge@shopify.com or leave a comment on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Shopify/gitcoin-bounties/issues/1).\r\n",

                "body": "## Description\r\nCreate an Agoric governance component using a VoteCounter that correctly evaluates election results for [instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting). \r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThe only vote counter currently is the BinaryVoteCounter, which presumes there are two positions on the ballot and assigns every vote to one or the other or to 'spoiled'. At the end, it looks for a majority winner and announces that. It can be configured to have one of the possible outcomes as the default outcome. If there's a tie and no default, the winner is undefined.\r\n\r\nContractGovernance uses this to make 'no change' be the default when voting on parameter changes.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nA successful bounty will:\r\n* Complete the requirements from the description including reasonable edge cases not explicitly defined\r\n* Pass code review from Agoric team\r\n* Include documented open source code and walkthrough presentation\r\n\r\n## Time Estimation\r\nOne Week\r\n\r\n## Reward\r\n$3,200\r\n\r\nPayment will be made in USD (fiat currency) via wire transfer. The developer is responsible for providing their completed tax documents (W9 for US based developers and/or W8 or W8-BEN-E for non-US based developers) and providing their banking details in order to receive payment. \r\n\r\n## Applicant Assessment Criteria\r\nImportant: Please provide a clear work plan for how you will approach this bounty.  Use the work plan as an initial demonstration that you would be a good candidate.  Bounties will require coordination with the Agoric team, so unfortunately only plans submitted in English will be considered.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n* Issue-specific domain experience\r\n* Issue-specific technical capability\r\n* Familiarity with Agoric's platform\r\n* JavaScript experience\r\n* Availability and communication\r\n\r\n## Experience Write-up (1000-1500 words)\r\nAs part of completing the bounty, we ask that you write up a short (or long!) summary of your experience building on Agoric. Write-up should:\r\n* Begin with a compelling, relevant introductory hook statement (<50 words). \r\n* Clearly explain the specific bounty project (~100 words). \r\n* Describe how the developer approached the problem (~300 words). \r\n* Give a step-by-step description of the solution (>500 words && <1000 words).\r\n* At least three code snippets per write-up. They do not count toward overall word count. \r\n* Conclude with clear calls to action on developing with Agoric - specifically how any ambition developer reading this piece could do more themselves (>150 words). \r\n\r\nThis is important feedback for us as we evolve the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Review Process\r\n* Agoric team reviews your submitted work plan on Gitcoin\r\n* It is best to join our Discord and post your gitcoin name in the bounties channel, so that we can follow up with you. Otherwise, we will write on your gitcoin profile wall and say hello!\r\n* Agoric contacts you to provide reference projects / sample code for engineering review\r\n* Introductory call to discuss your plans and expected timeline\r\n* You join the Agoric Discord bounties channel (if you haven\u2019t done so already) \r\n* Agoric accepts you on Gitcoin and you get started!\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Agoric Documentation](https://docs.agoric.com/)\r\n* [Agoric Governance Doc](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/governance)\r\n* [#bounties channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/585576150827532298/854426485900967988) for general questions and your private bounty channel for direct questions to the Agoric team",
