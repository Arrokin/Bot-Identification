                "body": "Let's add some flavor to our responses, dependent on how we roll. We can do this by using conditionals. We'll put a command that only triggers if a certain condition is met. For example, let's add \"Critical Fail\" in the printed statement if the die roll is a one.\n\nIn Python, we can set this as the criteria by replacing our print statement in the loop with:\n\n```python\nif roll == 1:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n```\n\nBut what if it's *not* a one? We need a catch-all for all the other conditions it could be. This is done in Python with the `else` command. Below our `if` statement and the related print function, add an `else` statement:\n\n```python\nelse:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\n```\n    \nNow we have two different statements that can be printed. Try running your code until you have a roll that is a one and a roll that is something else.\n\nIf we have additional conditions we want to add, we can use a third type of conditional in Python: `elif`. This is used for a specific condition after `if` has been used. Try adding this `elif` statement between the `if` and `else` statements:\n\n```python\nelif roll == 6:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n```\n\nWith the conditionals added, your main function should look something like this:\n\n```python\ndice_rolls = 2\ndice_sum = 0\nfor i in range(0,dice_rolls):\n  roll = random.randint(1,6)\n  dice_sum += roll\n  if roll == 1:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n  elif roll == 6:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n  else:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\nprint(f'You have rolled a total of {dice_sum}')\n```\n\nLeave a comment with the *number of rolls* it took to get a Critical Success.

                "body": "Wow, 3 rolls?!\n\n## Adding User Input\n\nWe have a working dice roller right now! It's useful for a very specific situation: rolling two six-sided dice. What if we want to change the number of dice we roll? We can manually edit the code each time, but there's a better way to do this: adding a user `input`.\n\nInstead of having `dice_rolls` set to a specific value, let's set it equal to:\n```python\nint(input('How many dice would you like to roll? '))\n```\n\nRunning the code will give a prompt with that question and we can input our desired number of dice. One thing to note: the value a user inputs defaults to a `str` type and we need it to be a whole number, or an `int` in Python; that's why we encompass the `input` command in an `int()`. Try it out!\n\nTabletop games use dice with all number of sides so it'll be useful to add a user input for that too. Below where you set `dice_rolls` add this line:\n\n```python\ndice_size = int(input('How many sides are the dice? '))\n```\n\nChange the max value of our roll like this\n```python\nroll = random.randint(1,dice_size)\n```\n\nWhen changing a value we had assumed to be a specific number previously, we need to make sure the rest of our code still makes sense.  All dice start with one, so our `if` statement regarding one still makes sense. Our `elif` statement regarding six doesn't though, as it is no longer guaranteed to be the highest number. Let's make it so our \"Critical Success\" line is printed to whatever the highest number of our desired dice is. The highest number a dice can roll is the same as the number of sides, so we just to replace our `elif` statement with:\n\n```python\nelif roll == dice_size:\n```\n\nTry it out! Now you can manually input the number of dice and number of sides on the dice knowing that the `Critical Success!` line will realign accordingly. \n\nYour final main function should look like this:\n\n```python\nimport random\ndice_rolls = int(input('How many dice would you like to roll? '))\ndice_size = int(input('How many sides are the dice? '))\ndice_sum = 0\nfor i in range(0,dice_rolls):\n  roll = random.randint(1,dice_size)\n  dice_sum += roll\n  if roll == 1:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n  elif roll == dice_size:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n  else:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\nprint(f'You have rolled a total of {dice_sum}')\n```\n\n**Push your code** to GitHub to continue:\n```\ngit add dice_roller.py\ngit commit -m \"Tutorial complete\"\ngit push\n```",

                "body": "Now we're ready to really build our quote bot. To test things out, we'll read all the quotes from a file and print the first one.\n\nFirst, you can remove our test quote, the print statement on line 2. You can either comment it out by adding a `#` at the start of the line, or remove it completely.\n\nNext, remove the other comments by deleting `#` from the start of the other four lines to get Python code like this:\n\n```\n  f = open(\"quotes.txt\")\n  quotes = f.readlines()\n  f.close()\n\n  print(quotes)\n```\n\nHere we are opening the `quotes.txt` file, reading all the lines into a new _variable_ called `quotes`, then closing the file (defined by the variable `f`). Finally, we print out the quotes.\n\nYou can run this code and we'll get a dump of _all_ the quotes in the quotes file. That's because Python stored them all in an _array_, which is a single variable that holds a list of values.\n\n## Print the first element of an array\n\nSince we only want one quote, we need to edit our code to print only the first value in the `quotes` array.\n\nIn your code, find the print line and add this special modifier `[0]` so that the line now reads:\n`  print(quotes[0])`\n\nThe square brackets tell Python that we want a specific item in the array. Since it starts counting at zero, we've grabbed the first item.\n\n## Comment with the first quote\n\nRun your code and copy the value to your clipboard.\n\nPaste the quote as a comment here and I'll follow up with next steps!\n",

                "body": "You've just run a fully functioning pipeline with 212 unique branches (53 states x 4 steps)! Imagine if you had coded that with a `for` loop and just one of those states threw an error? :grimacing:\n\nNow that you have your pipeline running with static branching, let's try to convert it into the other type of branching, dynamic. \n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Switch to dynamic branching\n\nIn our scenario, it doesn't matter too much whether we pick static or dynamic branching. Both can work for us. I chose to show you static first because inspecting and building pipelines with dynamic branching can be more mysterious. In dynamic branching, the naming given to each branch target is assigned randomly and dynamic branch targets do not appear in the diagram produced by `tar_visnetwork()`. But despite those inconveniences, dynamic branching is needed in many situations in order to build truly robust pipelines, so here we go ...\n\n#### Convert to dynamic branching\n\n- [ ] First, let's drop back down to just a few states while we get this new branching set up. Change to `states <- c('WI', 'MN', 'MI')` and run `tar_destroy()` to reset our pipeline (note: use `tar_destroy()` very sparingly and deliberately, as it wipes all previous pipeline builds).\n\n- [ ] We no longer need to use `tar_map()` to create a separate object containing our static branching output. In dynamic branching, we just add to individual `tar_target()` calls. We will move each of the four targets from `tar_map()` into the appropriate targets list individually. First, move your \"splitter\" target `nwis_inventory` into your list of targets just after `oldest_active_sites`.\n\n- [ ] Let's adjust this target to follow dynamic branching concepts. In dynamic branching, the output of each target is always combined back into a single object. So, `filter()`ing this dataset by state is not actually going to do anything. Instead of splitting the data apart by a branching variable (remember we used `tibble(state_abb = states)`?) as we do in static branching, we will use the `state_cd` column from `oldest_active_sites` as a grouping variable in preparation of subsequent targets that will be applied over those groups. You need to then add a special *targets* grouping (`tar_group()`) for it to be treated appropriately. Lastly, the default \"iteration\" in dynamic branching is by list, but we just set it up to use groups, so we need to change that. In the end, your \"splitter\" target should look like this:\n\n  ```r\n  tar_target(nwis_inventory,\n            oldest_active_sites %>%\n             group_by(state_cd) %>%\n             tar_group(),\n           iteration = \"group\")\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Now to download the data! Copy your `tar_target()` code for the `nwis_data` target and paste as a target after your `nwis_inventory` target. Make two small changes: replace `state_abb` with `nwis_inventory$state_cd` & add `pattern = map(nwis_inventory)` as an argument to `tar_target()`. This second part is what turns this into a dynamic branching target. It will apply the `retry(get_site_data())` call to each of the groups we defined in `nwis_inventory`. Continuing this idea, we can still get the state abbreviation to pass to `get_site_data()` by using the `state_cd` column from `nwis_inventory`. Since we grouped by `state_cd`, this will only have the one value.\n\n- [ ] Add the tallying step. Copy the `tar_target()` code for the `tally` target into your targets list. Add `pattern = map(nwis_data)` as the final argument to `tar_target()` to set that up to dynamically branch based on the same branching from the `nwis_data` target. \n\n- [ ] Since dynamic branching automatically combines the output into a single object, the `tally` target already represents the combined tallies per state. We no longer need `obs_tallies`! Delete that target :) Make sure you update the downstream targets that dependend on `obs_tallies` and have them use `tally` instead (just `data_coverage_png` in our case).\n\n- [ ] We are on our final step to convert to dynamic branching - our timeseries plots. This is a bit trickier because we were using our static branching `values` table to define the PNG filenames, but now won't have available to us. Instead, we will build them as part of our argument directly in the function. First, copy the target code for `timeseries_png` into the list of targets. Replace `state_plot_files` in the `plot_site_data()` command with the `sprintf()` command used to define `values` in the `tar_map()` command, which creates the string with the filename. Replace `state_abb` with `unique(nwis_data$State)`. Add `pattern = map(nwis_data)` as the final argument to `tar_target`.\n\n- [ ] Once again, dynamic branching will automatically combine the output into a single object. For file targets, that means a vector of the filenames. So, we need to change our `summary_state_timeseries_csv` target to take advantage of that. First, it can be a regular `tar_target()`, so replace `tar_combine()` with `tar_target()`. Next, delete `mapped_by_state_targets$timeseries_png` so that the very next argument to `tar_target()` is the command. Edit the second argument to the command to be `timeseries_png` instead of `!!!.x`. Note that I didn't ask you to add `pattern = map()` to this function. We don't need to add `pattern` here because we want to use the combined target as input, not each individual filename.\n\n- [ ] We need to adjust the function we used in that last target because it was setup to handle the output from a static branching step, not a dynamic one. There are two differences: 1) the static branching output for the filenames was not a single object, but a collection of objects (hence, `...` as our second argument for `summarize_targets()`), and 2) the individual filenames are known by the static branching approach, but only the hashed target names for the files are known in the dynamic branching approach. To fix the first difference, go to the `3_summarize/src/summarize_targets.R` file and update the function to accept a vector rather than multiple vectors for the second argument. To fix the second difference, go back to your `_targets.R` file and add `names()` around the input `timeseries_png`. This passes in the targets name for the dynamically created files, not just the filenames. Otherwise, `tar_meta()` won't know what you are talking about. The last note is that *targets* v0.5.0.9000 complains about passing in a vector as \"ambiguous\". You can fix this by wrapping your file vector argument used in `tar_meta()` with `all_of()` in your `summarize_targets()` function to get rid of the message.\n\n- [ ] Clean up! Delete any of the remaining static branching content. Delete the code that creates `mapped_by_state_targets` and make sure that `mapped_by_state_targets` does not appear in the your targets list.\n\n- [ ] Run `tar_visnetwork()` and inspect your pipeline diagram. Do all the steps and dependencies make sense? Do you notice anything that is disconnected from the pipeline? You may have caught this during the previous clean up step, but my pipeline looks like this:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13220910/125475294-edf74bb6-cbbf-41b3-afa5-8373dfdfe3fd.png)\n\nDo you see the function `combine_obs_tallies` in the bottom left that is disconnected from the pipeline? There are a few ways to move forward knowing that something is disconnected: 1) fixing it because it should be connected, 2) leaving it knowing that you will need it in the future, or 3) deleting it because it is no longer needed. We will do the third - go ahead and delete that function. It exists in *2_process/src/tally_site_obs.R*. Re-run `tar_visnetwork()`. It should no longer appear.\n\n#### Test\n\n- [ ] Now run `tar_make()`. Remember that we set this up to use only three states at first. What do you notice in your console as the pipeline builds with respect to target naming?\n\n- [ ] Once your pipeline builds using dynamic branching across three states, change your `states` object back to the full list,\n\n```r\nstates <- c('AL','AZ','AR','CA','CO','CT','DE','DC','FL','GA','ID','IL','IN','IA',\n            'KS','KY','LA','ME','MD','MA','MI','MN','MS','MO','MT','NE','NV','NH',\n            'NJ','NM','NY','NC','ND','OH','OK','OR','PA','RI','SC','SD','TN','TX',\n            'UT','VT','VA','WA','WV','WI','WY','AK','HI','GU','PR')\n```\n\n- [ ] Run `tar_visnetwork()`. Is it the same or different since updating the states?\n\n- [ ] Time to test the full thing! Run `tar_make()`. Since we used `tar_destroy()` between the last full state build and now, it will take awhile (~ 10 min).\n\n#### Commit\n\n- [ ] Commit and push your changes to GitHub. No need to make a PR yet, though; we'll keep working on this issue for a few more minutes first before getting human feedback.\n\nOnce you've committed and pushed your changes to GitHub, comment about some of the differences you notice when running this pipeline using the dynamic branching approach vs our original static branching approach. Include a screenshot of the result in your viewer from your last `tar_visnetwork()` showing your dynamic branching pipeline.\n\n<hr><h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I see your comment.</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Let's get familiar with the files in our repo:\n\n- `README.md`: a markdown introduction to this project\n- `get-quote.py`: the file where we'll write our Python code\n- `quotes.txt`: a text file with a list of quotes\n\nOpen up `get-quote.py` and comment out line 2 by removing the `#` from the beginning of the line. It will look like this:\n```\n  print(\"Keep it logically awesome.\")\n```\n\nThe two spaces (or one tab) in front of the line is important. Python uses whitespace to organize code. This print line is part of the `main()` function. But more on that in the next step. First, let's try running that Python script.\n\nUse the Python 3 command to run the script. From the command line, type one of the following:\n\n- `python get-quote.py`\n- `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nYou should see our first quote, the one hard-coded into line 2, printed out in your terminal:\n`Keep it logically awesome.`\n\n## Push your changes\n\nYou've edited your local code, so you have a more recent version than is stored in this repository. You can check that any time by running: `git status`\n\nIt should show one file modified. Every time we want to send our local changes to GitHub, we need to perform three steps:\n\n1. Add the file(s) with changes: `git add get-quote.py`\n2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Hello World\"`\n3. Push the changes: `git push`\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, we'll write some more Python.\n",

Now let's try making some changes...\n\nNotice that the first and last lines of the Python file reference `main()`. That's a Python function and it runs automatically every time you call the script. But only because _we told it to_.\n\nTry changing the name to something else--almost anything, as long as it doesn't have spaces and isn't a [reserved word](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/keywords.html).\n\nMaybe use a synonym of main, such as `primary`.\n\nThe important thing is to change it in _both places_, the first line and the last line.\n\nNow run your code again: `python get-quote.py` or `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nIf you get an error, you might have only changed `main` in one place, or removed the important `()` from after the name. You'd also get an error if you changed that `__main__` thing (line 10), so leave that one be.\n\n## Push your changes\n\nWhen your Python script is running, you'll see the quote again.\n\nTo move on to the next step, push your changes:\n\n- `git add get-quote.py`\n- `git commit -m \"Renamed the primary function\"`\n- `git push`\n\nWhen I see the push come through, I'll share your next steps!\n",

GitHub Pages allow you to serve a static site from a repository. We've filled this repository with some site content, but the rendered site isn't visible right now.

Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section\n1. From the \"Source\" drop down, select **main branch**\n\n> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes. You'll have the opportunity to apply a theme when the course is completed. \n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>\n\n> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository.

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

                "body": "\n### :keyboard: Activity: Use fault tolerant approaches to running `tar_make()`\n\nRather than babysitting repeated `tar_make()` calls until all the states build, it's time to adapt our approach to running `tar_make()` when there are steps plagued by network failures. A lot of times, you just need to retry the download/upload again and it will work. This is not always the case though and sometimes, you need to address the failures. The *targets* package does not currently offer this fault tolerance, so the approaches discussed here are designed by our group to provide fault tolerance for tasks such as this data pull (including those where the \"failures\" are all real rather than being largely synthetic as in this project :wink:). \n\n#### Understand your options\n\nThere are a few choices to consider when thinking about fault tolerance in pipelines and they can be separated into two categories - how you want the full pipeline to behave vs. how you want to handle individual targets.  \n\nChoices for handling errors in the full pipeline:\n\n1. You want the pipeline build to come to a grinding hault if any of the targets throw an error.\n2. You want to come back and rebuild the target that is failing but not let that stop other targets from building.\n\nIf you want the first approach, congrats! That's how the pipeline behaves by default and there is no need for you to change anything. If you want the pipeline to keep going but return to build that target later, you should add `error = 'continue'` to your `tar_option_set()` call. \n\nNow let's talk about handling errors for individual targets. There are also a few ideas to consider here.\n\n1. If the target fails, you want that target to return no data and keep going. \n2. If the target fails, you want to retry building that target `n` times (in case of internet flakyness) before ultimately considering it a failed target. \n\nIf you want a failure to still be considered a completed build, then consider implementing `tryCatch` in your download/upload function to gracefully handle errors, return something (e.g. `data.frame()`) from the function, and allow the code to continue. If you want to retry a target before moving on in the pipeline, then we can use the function `retry::retry()`. This is a function from the *retry* package, which you may or may not have installed. Go ahead and check that you have this package before continuing. \n\nWrapping a target `command` with `retry()` will keep building that target until there are no errors OR until it runs out of `max_tries`. You can also set the `when` argument of `retry()` to declare what error message should initiate a rebuild (the input to `when` can be a [regular expression](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions)).\n\n#### Test\n\n- [ ] Add code to load the package *retry* at the top of your *_targets.R* file.\n\n- [ ] Wrap the `get_site_data()` function in your static branching code with `retry()`. The `retry()` function should look for the error message matching `\"Ugh, the internet data transfer failed!\"` and should rerun `get_site_data()` a maximum of 30 times. \n\n- [ ] Now run `tar_make()`. It will redownload data for *all* of the states since we updated the `command` for `nwis_data`. It will take awhile since it is downloading all of them at least once and may need to retry some up to 30 times. Grab a tea or coffee while you wait (~ 10 min) - at least there's no babysitting needed!\n\n#### Commit\n\n- [ ] Commit and push your changes to GitHub. No need to make a PR yet, though; we'll keep working on this issue for a few more minutes first before getting human feedback.\n\nComment once you've committed and pushed your changes to GitHub.\n\n<hr><h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I see your comment.</h3>\n",

It will look like this:\n```\n  print(\"Keep it logically awesome.\")\n```\n\nThe two spaces (or one tab) in front of the line is important. Python uses whitespace to organize code. This print line is part of the `main()` function. But more on that in the next step. First, let's try running that Python script.\n\nUse the Python 3 command to run the script. From the command line, type one of the following:\n\n- `python get-quote.py`\n- `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nYou should see our first quote, the one hard-coded into line 2, printed out in your terminal:\n`Keep it logically awesome.`\n\n## Push your changes\n\nYou've edited your local code, so you have a more recent version than is stored in this repository. You can check that any time by running: `git status`\n\nIt should show one file modified. Every time we want to send our local changes to GitHub, we need to perform three steps:\n\n1. Add the file(s) with changes: `git add get-quote.py`\n2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Hello World\"`\n3. Push the changes: `git push`\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, we'll write some more Python.\n",

Millions of open source repositories on GitHub are public, too!\n\nLicenses, code of conduct, and other files are important when you create a public repository. There are many benefits to this, but it's also a large responsibility. Keep in mind that once a repository is public _and_ open source, there are certain implications about keeping it public, depending on the license chosen.\n\n> It's important to note that public does **not** equal open source!

The following activity provides instructions to move your local project to GitHub using various tools. Select the tool you are most comfortable with and get importing :smile:.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Moving your local project\n\n1. In the **Code** tab of this repository, copy the URL shown under **Quick Setup**.\n1. Follow the instructions below based on what tool you'd like to use locally.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Using the command line</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Using the command line\n\n  1. In your command line, navigate to your project directory. Type `git init` to initialize the directory as a Git repository.\n  2. Type `git remote add origin https://github.com/justWeverton/github-upload.git`\n  3. Type `git add .`\n  4. Type `git commit -m \"initializing repository\"`\n  5. Type `git push -u origin main` to push the files you have locally to the remote on GitHub. (You may be asked to log in.)\n\n  **Note:** You can also use a password protected SSH key to connect to GitHub. See [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) in our documentation to learn more.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Using GitHub Desktop</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Using GitHub Desktop\n\nGitHub Desktop doesn't allow you to add a new remote for an existing directory, so instead we'll copy the contents of your existing folder to our repo. If you'd like to keep your existing folder, you may want to use the command line or one of the other tools.\n\n  1. In GitHub Desktop, click on **File** and **Clone a repository**.\n  2. Click on the **URL** tab.\n  3. Paste the URL from this repository.\n  4. Move the contents of your local repository to this directory.\n  5. Create a commit by entering a commit message and then clicking on **Commit to main**\n  6.

The following activity provides instructions to move your local project to GitHub using various tools. Select the tool you are most comfortable with and get importing :smile:.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Moving your local project\n\n1. In the **Code** tab of this repository, copy the URL shown under **Quick Setup**.\n1.

For example, you could be working in repositories with a lot of history, many collaborators, or many files.\n\nBefore you take this course, you may want to go through the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on Learning Lab.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to do lots of things, like:\n\n- Find relevant issues and pull requests\n- Search history to find context\n- Make connections within GitHub to help others find things\n\n### Cross-linking issues and pull requests\n\nGitHub has special capabilities to help reference other information on GitHub. For example, when you reference another issue or pull request by number, that number will be hyperlinked. At the same time, a cross-reference is created in the linked issue or pull request. This two-way reference helps people track the relationship of information across GitHub.\n\n![a screenshot of an issue linking to a PR, and a PR with a cross-reference to the issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/67594663-d9710900-f732-11e9-8df8-d3173d952bd5.png)\n\n## Step 1: Find an issue\n\nBelow, you will see a reference to another issue. The other issue references _this_ issue. The other issue appears to be a duplicate, so it would be a good idea to close it.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Find and close the cross-linked issue\n\n1. Navigate to the other issue referenced from this issue\n2. Close that issue\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I will respond with your next steps in that issue.</h3>\n",

                "body": "So far we've implemented *split* and *apply* operations; now it's time to explore *combine* operations in **targets** pipelines.\n\nIn this issue you'll add two *combiners* to serve different purposes - the first will combine all of the annual observation tallies into one giant table, and the second will summarize the set of state-specific timeseries plots generated by the task table. \n\n### Background\n\n#### Approach\n\nGiven your current level of knowledge, if you were asked to add a target combining the tally outputs you would likely add a call to `tar_target` and use the branches as input to a `command` that aggregated the data. While this would certainly work, the number of inputs to a combiner should change if the number of tasks changes. If we hand-coded a combiner target with `tar_target` that accepted a set of inputs (e.g., `tar_target(combined_tallies, combine_tallies(tally_WI, tally_MI, [etc]))`), we'd need to manually edit the inputs to that function anytime we changed the `states` vector. That would be a pain and would make our pipeline susceptible to human error if we forgot or made a mistake in that editing. \n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe **targets** way to use combiners for static branching is to work with the `tar_combine()` function (recall that **combiners** are automatically applied to the output in dynamic branching). `tar_combine()` is set up in a similar way to `tar_target()`, where you supply the target name and a function to the target as the `command`. The difference is that the input to the `command` will be multiple targets passed in to the `...` argument. The output from a `tar_combine()` can be an R object or a file, but file targets need to have `format = \"file\"` passed in to `tar_combine()` and the function used as `command` must return the filepath.  \n\nSome additional implementation considerations:\n\n* In order to use `tar_combine()` with the output from `tar_map()`, you will need to save the output of `tar_map()` as an object. Thus, the branching declaration should look something like `mapped_output <- tar_map()` so that `mapped_output` can be used in your `tar_combine()` call.\n\n* You can write your own combiner function or you can use built-in combiner functions for common types of combining (such as `bind_rows()`, `c()`, etc). If you write your own combiner function, it needs to be in a script sourced in the makefile using `source()`. The default combiner is `?vctrs::vec_c`, which is a a fancy version of `c()` that ensures the resulting vector keeps the common data type (e.g. factors remain factors).\n\n* When you pass the output of `tar_map()` to `tar_combine()`, all branch output from `tar_map()` will be used by default. If you had multiple steps in your `tar_map()` (i.e. multiple calls to `tar_target()`), and you only want to combine results from one of those, you can add `unlist = FALSE` to your `tar_map()` call so that the `tar_map()` output remained in a nested list. This makes it possible to reference just the output from each `tar_target()` and use in `tar_combine()`. For example, if you had three steps in your `tap_map()` call and you wanted to combine only those branches from the third step that had a target name of `sum_resuts`, you could use `mapped_output[[3]]` or `mapped_output$sum_results` as the input to `tar_combine()`. \n\n* Within your `tar_combine()` function, pass the `...` to your `command` function by specifying `!!!.x` in its place. It feels strange, but has to do with how the function handles non-standard evaluation. You can see an example of using this syntax when you look at the default for `command` in thehelp file for `?tarchetypes::tar_combine()`.\n\n* When specifying the `command` argument to `tar_combine()`, you need to include the argument, e.g. `command = my_function()`. Since `tar_combine()` has `...` as its second argument, anything else you pass in without the argument name will be considered part of `...`. It can result in some weird errors.\n\nDon't worry if not all of this clicked yet. We are about to see it all in action!\n",

Now that you have a branch, it\u2019s time to create a file and make your first commit!\n\n<details><summary>Commits 101</summary>\n\n## Commits 101\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the \"Commit new file\" section.\n\nIn the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.\n\n### Rules to live by for commit messages:\n\n- Don\u2019t end your commit message with a period.\n- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.\n- Use active voice. For example, \"add\" instead of \"added\" and \"merge\" instead of \"merged\".\n- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.\n\n\n1. Create a new file on this branch, in a `_posts` folder called `0000-01-02-omm17.md`. You can do so using [this shortcut](https://github.com/omm17/github-slideshow/new/new-branch?filename=_posts/0000-01-02-omm17.md) or manually as follows:\n      - Return to the \"Code\" tab\n      - In the branch drop-down, select \"new-branch\"\n      - Click **Create new file**\n      - In the \"file name\" field, type `_posts/0000-01-02-omm17.md`. Entering the `/` in the filename will automatically place your file in the `_posts` directory.\n1. When you\u2019re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:\n      ```yaml\n      ---\n      layout: slide\n      title: \"Welcome to our second slide!\"\n      ---\n      Your text\n      Use the left arrow to go back!\n      ```\n1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the **Commits 101** drop-down, just above these instructions\n1. When you\u2019ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

Where issues encourage discussion with other contributors and collaborators on a project, pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until they\u2019re perfect!\n\n<details><summary>What is a pull request?</summary>\n\n## Pull requests\n\nLet\u2019s think back to the GitHub flow again. You have created a branch, added a file, and committed the file to your branch. Now it\u2019s time to collaborate on your file with other students taking this class. This collaboration happens in a pull request. Check out this video to learn more:\n\n:tv: [Video: Introduction to pull requests](https://youtu.be/kJr-PIfLDl4)\n<hr>\n</details>\n\nThis pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` branch.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request\n\n1. Open a pull request using [this shortcut](https://github.com/NIKHIL-RAJIV/github-slideshow/compare/refs/heads/my-slide?expand=1) or manually as follows:\n    - From the \"Pull requests\" tab, click **New pull request**\n    - In the \"base:\" drop-down menu, make sure the \"main\" branch is selected\n    - In the \"compare:\" drop-down menu, select \"my-slide\"\n1. When you\u2019ve selected your branch, enter a title for your pull request. For example `Add NIKHIL-RAJIV's file`\n1. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Feel free to add a description of what you\u2019ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a branch, created a file and made a commit, and opened a pull request\n1. Click **Create pull request**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in your new pull request.</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.\n\n### Tips for using branches\n\nA single project can have hundreds of branches, each suggesting a new change to the `main` branch.\n\nThe best way to keep branches organized with a team is to keep them concise and short-lived. In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors when branches are only active for a few days before they\u2019re merged <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge)</sup> into the `main` branch.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the [Code tab](https://github.com/Babschiin/github-slideshow)\n2. Click **Branch: main** in the drop-down\n3. In the field, enter a name for your branch, like `my-slide`\n4.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Now that you have a branch, it\u2019s time to create a file and make your first commit!\n\n<details><summary>Commits 101</summary>\n\n## Commits 101\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the \"Commit new file\" section.\n\nIn the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.\n\n### Rules to live by for commit messages:\n\n- Don\u2019t end your commit message with a period.\n- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.\n- Use active voice. For example, \"add\" instead of \"added\" and \"merge\" instead of \"merged\".\n- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.\n\n\n1. Create a new file on this branch, in a `_posts` folder called `0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md`. You can do so using [this shortcut](https://github.com/NIKHIL-RAJIV/github-slideshow/new/slideshow?filename=_posts/0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md) or manually as follows:\n      - Return to the \"Code\" tab\n      - In the branch drop-down, select \"slideshow\"\n      - Click **Create new file**\n      - In the \"file name\" field, type `_posts/0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md`. Entering the `/` in the filename will automatically place your file in the `_posts` directory.\n1. When you\u2019re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:\n      ```yaml\n      ---\n      layout: slide\n      title: \"Welcome to our second slide!\"\n      ---\n      Your text\n      Use the left arrow to go back!\n      ```\n1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the **Commits 101** drop-down, just above these instructions\n1. When you\u2019ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs.

GitHub Pages allow you to serve a static site from a repository. We've filled this repository with some site content, but the rendered site isn't visible right now. Let's change that.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages\n\n1. Click on the [**Settings**](https://github.com/heiskr/github-slideshow/settings) tab in this repository\n1. Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section\n1. From the \"Source\" drop down, select **main branch**\n\n> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes. You'll have the opportunity to apply a theme when the course is completed. \n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>\n\n> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors when branches are only active for a few days before they\u2019re merged <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge)</sup> into the `main` branch.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the [Code tab](https://github.com/omm17/github-slideshow)\n2. Click **Branch: main** in the drop-down\n3. In the field, enter a name for your branch, like `my-slide`\n4.

Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5.

                "body": "## Step 2: Prepare the project\n\n### Working with Binary files\n\nIn general, there are two types of files: text files and binary files.\n\nText files, like most code files, are easily tracked with Git and are very lightweight.\n\nHowever, binary files like spreadsheets, presentations with slides, and videos don't work well with Git. If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @julimurphy since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update! If you perform an expected action and don't see a response from me, wait a few seconds and refresh the page for your next steps._\n",

If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @justWeverton since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update!

If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @justWeverton since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update! If you perform an expected action and don't see a response from me, wait a few seconds and refresh the page for your next steps._\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5.

You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

For more information, see \u201c[Receiving notifications about activity on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/) in the *GitHub Help*.\n\n  ```\n  @githubteacher\n  ```\n\n  @githubteacher\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Cross Links</summary>\n\n  ### Cross Links\n\n  To bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within a repository, type `#`. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.\n\n  Additionally, references to issues and pull requests are automatically converted to shortened links to the issue or pull request. For example,\n\n  | Reference type | Raw reference | Short link |\n  | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |\n  | Issue or pull request URL | `https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602` | [#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `#` and issue or pull request number | #3602 | [#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `GH-` and issue or pull request number | GH-3602 | [GH-3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `Username/Repository#` and issue or pull request number | desktop/desktop#3602 | [desktop/desktop#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n\n  For more information, see \u201c[Autolinked references and URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/)\u201d in the *GitHub Help*.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Linking Specific Commits</summary>\n\n  ### Linking Specific Commits\n\n  References to a commit's ID (commonly called a SHA or hash) are automatically converted into shortened links to the commit on GitHub. For example,\n\n  | Reference type | Raw reference | Short link |\n  | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |\n  | Commit URL | https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | SHA | 8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | User@SHA | desktop@8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [desktop@8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | Username/Repository@SHA | User/Repository@SHA: desktop/desktop@8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [desktop/desktop@8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87)|\n\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Formatting Markdown\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Quotes</summary>\n\n  ### Quotes\n\n  You can create quote text with a `>`.\n\n  ```\n  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:\n\n  > Pardon my French\n  ```\n\n  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:\n\n  > Pardon my French\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Tables</summary>\n\n   ### Tables\n\n   You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n    ```\n    First Header | Second Header\n    ------------ | -------------\n    Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\n    Content in the first column | Content in the second column\n    ```\n\n  First Header | Second Header\n  ------------ | -------------\n  Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\n  Content in the first column | Content in the second column\n\n  For more detail on formatting with tables, see \"Organizing information with tables\" in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Inline Code Blocks</summary>\n\n  ### Inline Code Blocks\n\n  Certain words and phrases need to be formatted in monospace fonts, especially when writing about code. As you've seen throughout this lab, words can be distinguished in markdown with `inline code blocks`.\n\n  Inline code is just one ``` character on either side of the text, and can be used within paragraphs, headers, or other Markdown.\n\n  ```\n  `inline code is just one backtick`\n  ```\n\n  `inline code is just one backtick`\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Separate Code Blocks</summary>\n\n  ### Separate Code Blocks\n\n  To separate out a larger block of code, use three ``` characters instead of one, and set the text aside in its own paragraph.\n\n  What we type:\n  \n    ```\n    Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:\n    ```\n    \n  What we see:\n  \n  ```\n  Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:\n   ```\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Syntax Highlighting</summary>\n\n  ### Syntax Highlighting\n\n  In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as Javascript or command-line text.\n\n  What we type:\n\n      ```sh\n      github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository\n      $ git init\n      Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/\n      ```\n\n  What we see:\n  ```sh\n  github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository\n  $ git init\n  Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/\n  ```\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Summary dropdown</summary>\n\n  ### Summary dropdown\n\n  Most of the text in this issue is formatted in collapsible summary blocks. Here's how to make them with Markdown:\n\n  ```\n  <details>\n    <summary>Title</summary>\n\n    Content here\n\n  </details>\n  ```\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\nWant to keep learning?

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "Nice, you just added an action block to your workflow file! Here are some important details about _why_ each part of the block exists and _what_ each part does.\n\n- `jobs:` is the base component of a workflow run\n- `build:` is the identifier we're attaching to this job\n- `name:` is the name of the job, this is displayed on GitHub when the workflow is running\n- `runs-on:` defines the type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner.\n- `steps:` the linear sequence of operations that make up a job\n- `uses: actions/checkout@v1` uses a community action called [`checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to allow the workflow to access the contents of the repository\n- `uses: ./action-a` provides the relative path to the action we created in the `action-a` directory of the repository\n- `with`: is used to specify the input variables that will be available to your action in the runtime environment. In this case, the input variable is `MY_NAME`, and it is currently initialized to `\"Mona\"`.\n\n### Your action has been triggered!\n\nYour repository now contains an action (defined in the `/action-a/` folder) and a workflow (defined in the `./github/workflows/main.yml` file).\n\nThis action will run any time a new commit is created or pushed to the remote repository. Since you just created a commit, the workflow should have been triggered. This might take a few minutes since it's the first time running in this repository.\n\n### Seeing your Action in action\n\nThe status of your action is shown here in the pull request (look for **All checks have passed** below), or you can click the \"Actions\" tab in your repository. From there you will see the actions that have run, and you can click on the action's \"Log\" link to view details.\n\n![View an action's log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/62388049-4e64e600-b52a-11e9-8bf5-db0c5452360f.png)\n\n## Step 6: Trigger the workflow\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: See your action trigger the workflow\n\nYou've done the work, now sit back and see your action trigger the workflow!\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I will respond when I detect your action has run and reported a status.</h3>\n\n> _Actions can take a minute or two to run. Sometimes, I also respond too fast for the page to update! If you don't see a response from your action, wait a few seconds and refresh the page._\n",

Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "Let's add some flavor to our responses, dependent on how we roll. We can do this by using conditionals. We'll put a command that only triggers if a certain condition is met. For example, let's add \"Critical Fail\" in the printed statement if the die roll is a one.\n\nIn Python, we can set this as the criteria by replacing our print statement in the loop with:\n\n```python\nif roll == 1:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n```\n\nBut what if it's *not* a one? We need a catch-all for all the other conditions it could be. This is done in Python with the `else` command. Below our `if` statement and the related print function, add an `else` statement:\n\n```python\nelse:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\n```\n    \nNow we have two different statements that can be printed. Try running your code until you have a roll that is a one and a roll that is something else.\n\nIf we have additional conditions we want to add, we can use a third type of conditional in Python: `elif`. This is used for a specific condition after `if` has been used. Try adding this `elif` statement between the `if` and `else` statements:\n\n```python\nelif roll == 6:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n```\n\nWith the conditionals added, your main function should look something like this:\n\n```python\ndice_rolls = 2\ndice_sum = 0\nfor i in range(0,dice_rolls):\n  roll = random.randint(1,6)\n  dice_sum += roll\n  if roll == 1:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n  elif roll == 6:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n  else:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\nprint(f'You have rolled a total of {dice_sum}')\n```\n\nLeave a comment with the *number of rolls* it took to get a Critical Success.

                "body": "Wow, 3 rolls?!\n\n## Adding User Input\n\nWe have a working dice roller right now! It's useful for a very specific situation: rolling two six-sided dice. What if we want to change the number of dice we roll? We can manually edit the code each time, but there's a better way to do this: adding a user `input`.\n\nInstead of having `dice_rolls` set to a specific value, let's set it equal to:\n```python\nint(input('How many dice would you like to roll? '))\n```\n\nRunning the code will give a prompt with that question and we can input our desired number of dice. One thing to note: the value a user inputs defaults to a `str` type and we need it to be a whole number, or an `int` in Python; that's why we encompass the `input` command in an `int()`. Try it out!\n\nTabletop games use dice with all number of sides so it'll be useful to add a user input for that too. Below where you set `dice_rolls` add this line:\n\n```python\ndice_size = int(input('How many sides are the dice? '))\n```\n\nChange the max value of our roll like this\n```python\nroll = random.randint(1,dice_size)\n```\n\nWhen changing a value we had assumed to be a specific number previously, we need to make sure the rest of our code still makes sense.  All dice start with one, so our `if` statement regarding one still makes sense. Our `elif` statement regarding six doesn't though, as it is no longer guaranteed to be the highest number. Let's make it so our \"Critical Success\" line is printed to whatever the highest number of our desired dice is. The highest number a dice can roll is the same as the number of sides, so we just to replace our `elif` statement with:\n\n```python\nelif roll == dice_size:\n```\n\nTry it out! Now you can manually input the number of dice and number of sides on the dice knowing that the `Critical Success!` line will realign accordingly. \n\nYour final main function should look like this:\n\n```python\nimport random\ndice_rolls = int(input('How many dice would you like to roll? '))\ndice_size = int(input('How many sides are the dice? '))\ndice_sum = 0\nfor i in range(0,dice_rolls):\n  roll = random.randint(1,dice_size)\n  dice_sum += roll\n  if roll == 1:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n  elif roll == dice_size:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n  else:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\nprint(f'You have rolled a total of {dice_sum}')\n```\n\n**Push your code** to GitHub to continue:\n```\ngit add dice_roller.py\ngit commit -m \"Tutorial complete\"\ngit push\n```",

To test things out, we'll read all the quotes from a file and print the first one.\n\nFirst, you can remove our test quote, the print statement on line 2. You can either comment it out by adding a `#` at the start of the line, or remove it completely.\n\nNext, remove the other comments by deleting `#` from the start of the other four lines to get Python code like this:\n\n```\n  f = open(\"quotes.txt\")\n  quotes = f.readlines()\n  f.close()\n\n  print(quotes)\n```\n\nHere we are opening the `quotes.txt` file, reading all the lines into a new _variable_ called `quotes`, then closing the file (defined by the variable `f`). Finally, we print out the quotes.\n\nYou can run this code and we'll get a dump of _all_ the quotes in the quotes file. That's because Python stored them all in an _array_, which is a single variable that holds a list of values.\n\n## Print the first element of an array\n\nSince we only want one quote, we need to edit our code to print only the first value in the `quotes` array.\n\nIn your code, find the print line and add this special modifier `[0]` so that the line now reads:\n`  print(quotes[0])`\n\nThe square brackets tell Python that we want a specific item in the array. Since it starts counting at zero, we've grabbed the first item.\n\n## Comment with the first quote\n\nRun your code and copy the value to your clipboard.\n\nPaste the quote as a comment here and I'll follow up with next steps!\n",

                "body": "You've just run a fully functioning pipeline with 212 unique branches (53 states x 4 steps)! Imagine if you had coded that with a `for` loop and just one of those states threw an error? :grimacing:\n\nNow that you have your pipeline running with static branching, let's try to convert it into the other type of branching, dynamic. \n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Switch to dynamic branching\n\nIn our scenario, it doesn't matter too much whether we pick static or dynamic branching. Both can work for us. I chose to show you static first because inspecting and building pipelines with dynamic branching can be more mysterious. In dynamic branching, the naming given to each branch target is assigned randomly and dynamic branch targets do not appear in the diagram produced by `tar_visnetwork()`. But despite those inconveniences, dynamic branching is needed in many situations in order to build truly robust pipelines, so here we go ...\n\n#### Convert to dynamic branching\n\n- [ ] First, let's drop back down to just a few states while we get this new branching set up. Change to `states <- c('WI', 'MN', 'MI')` and run `tar_destroy()` to reset our pipeline (note: use `tar_destroy()` very sparingly and deliberately, as it wipes all previous pipeline builds).\n\n- [ ] We no longer need to use `tar_map()` to create a separate object containing our static branching output. In dynamic branching, we just add to individual `tar_target()` calls. We will move each of the four targets from `tar_map()` into the appropriate targets list individually. First, move your \"splitter\" target `nwis_inventory` into your list of targets just after `oldest_active_sites`.\n\n- [ ] Let's adjust this target to follow dynamic branching concepts. In dynamic branching, the output of each target is always combined back into a single object. So, `filter()`ing this dataset by state is not actually going to do anything. Instead of splitting the data apart by a branching variable (remember we used `tibble(state_abb = states)`?) as we do in static branching, we will use the `state_cd` column from `oldest_active_sites` as a grouping variable in preparation of subsequent targets that will be applied over those groups. You need to then add a special *targets* grouping (`tar_group()`) for it to be treated appropriately. Lastly, the default \"iteration\" in dynamic branching is by list, but we just set it up to use groups, so we need to change that. In the end, your \"splitter\" target should look like this:\n\n  ```r\n  tar_target(nwis_inventory,\n            oldest_active_sites %>%\n             group_by(state_cd) %>%\n             tar_group(),\n           iteration = \"group\")\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Now to download the data! Copy your `tar_target()` code for the `nwis_data` target and paste as a target after your `nwis_inventory` target. Make two small changes: replace `state_abb` with `nwis_inventory$state_cd` & add `pattern = map(nwis_inventory)` as an argument to `tar_target()`. This second part is what turns this into a dynamic branching target. It will apply the `retry(get_site_data())` call to each of the groups we defined in `nwis_inventory`. Continuing this idea, we can still get the state abbreviation to pass to `get_site_data()` by using the `state_cd` column from `nwis_inventory`. Since we grouped by `state_cd`, this will only have the one value.\n\n- [ ] Add the tallying step. Copy the `tar_target()` code for the `tally` target into your targets list. Add `pattern = map(nwis_data)` as the final argument to `tar_target()` to set that up to dynamically branch based on the same branching from the `nwis_data` target. \n\n- [ ] Since dynamic branching automatically combines the output into a single object, the `tally` target already represents the combined tallies per state. We no longer need `obs_tallies`! Delete that target :) Make sure you update the downstream targets that dependend on `obs_tallies` and have them use `tally` instead (just `data_coverage_png` in our case).\n\n- [ ] We are on our final step to convert to dynamic branching - our timeseries plots. This is a bit trickier because we were using our static branching `values` table to define the PNG filenames, but now won't have available to us. Instead, we will build them as part of our argument directly in the function. First, copy the target code for `timeseries_png` into the list of targets. Replace `state_plot_files` in the `plot_site_data()` command with the `sprintf()` command used to define `values` in the `tar_map()` command, which creates the string with the filename. Replace `state_abb` with `unique(nwis_data$State)`. Add `pattern = map(nwis_data)` as the final argument to `tar_target`.\n\n- [ ] Once again, dynamic branching will automatically combine the output into a single object. For file targets, that means a vector of the filenames. So, we need to change our `summary_state_timeseries_csv` target to take advantage of that. First, it can be a regular `tar_target()`, so replace `tar_combine()` with `tar_target()`. Next, delete `mapped_by_state_targets$timeseries_png` so that the very next argument to `tar_target()` is the command. Edit the second argument to the command to be `timeseries_png` instead of `!!!.x`. Note that I didn't ask you to add `pattern = map()` to this function. We don't need to add `pattern` here because we want to use the combined target as input, not each individual filename.\n\n- [ ] We need to adjust the function we used in that last target because it was setup to handle the output from a static branching step, not a dynamic one. There are two differences: 1) the static branching output for the filenames was not a single object, but a collection of objects (hence, `...` as our second argument for `summarize_targets()`), and 2) the individual filenames are known by the static branching approach, but only the hashed target names for the files are known in the dynamic branching approach. To fix the first difference, go to the `3_summarize/src/summarize_targets.R` file and update the function to accept a vector rather than multiple vectors for the second argument. To fix the second difference, go back to your `_targets.R` file and add `names()` around the input `timeseries_png`. This passes in the targets name for the dynamically created files, not just the filenames. Otherwise, `tar_meta()` won't know what you are talking about. The last note is that *targets* v0.5.0.9000 complains about passing in a vector as \"ambiguous\". You can fix this by wrapping your file vector argument used in `tar_meta()` with `all_of()` in your `summarize_targets()` function to get rid of the message.\n\n- [ ] Clean up! Delete any of the remaining static branching content. Delete the code that creates `mapped_by_state_targets` and make sure that `mapped_by_state_targets` does not appear in the your targets list.\n\n- [ ] Run `tar_visnetwork()` and inspect your pipeline diagram. Do all the steps and dependencies make sense? Do you notice anything that is disconnected from the pipeline? You may have caught this during the previous clean up step, but my pipeline looks like this:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13220910/125475294-edf74bb6-cbbf-41b3-afa5-8373dfdfe3fd.png)\n\nDo you see the function `combine_obs_tallies` in the bottom left that is disconnected from the pipeline? There are a few ways to move forward knowing that something is disconnected: 1) fixing it because it should be connected, 2) leaving it knowing that you will need it in the future, or 3) deleting it because it is no longer needed. We will do the third - go ahead and delete that function. It exists in *2_process/src/tally_site_obs.R*. Re-run `tar_visnetwork()`. It should no longer appear.\n\n#### Test\n\n- [ ] Now run `tar_make()`. Remember that we set this up to use only three states at first. What do you notice in your console as the pipeline builds with respect to target naming?\n\n- [ ] Once your pipeline builds using dynamic branching across three states, change your `states` object back to the full list,\n\n```r\nstates <- c('AL','AZ','AR','CA','CO','CT','DE','DC','FL','GA','ID','IL','IN','IA',\n            'KS','KY','LA','ME','MD','MA','MI','MN','MS','MO','MT','NE','NV','NH',\n            'NJ','NM','NY','NC','ND','OH','OK','OR','PA','RI','SC','SD','TN','TX',\n            'UT','VT','VA','WA','WV','WI','WY','AK','HI','GU','PR')\n```\n\n- [ ] Run `tar_visnetwork()`. Is it the same or different since updating the states?\n\n- [ ] Time to test the full thing! Run `tar_make()`. Since we used `tar_destroy()` between the last full state build and now, it will take awhile (~ 10 min).\n\n#### Commit\n\n- [ ] Commit and push your changes to GitHub. No need to make a PR yet, though; we'll keep working on this issue for a few more minutes first before getting human feedback.\n\nOnce you've committed and pushed your changes to GitHub, comment about some of the differences you notice when running this pipeline using the dynamic branching approach vs our original static branching approach. Include a screenshot of the result in your viewer from your last `tar_visnetwork()` showing your dynamic branching pipeline.\n\n<hr><h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I see your comment.</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Let's get familiar with the files in our repo:\n\n- `README.md`: a markdown introduction to this project\n- `get-quote.py`: the file where we'll write our Python code\n- `quotes.txt`: a text file with a list of quotes\n\nOpen up `get-quote.py` and comment out line 2 by removing the `#` from the beginning of the line. It will look like this:\n```\n  print(\"Keep it logically awesome.\")\n```\n\nThe two spaces (or one tab) in front of the line is important. Python uses whitespace to organize code. This print line is part of the `main()` function. But more on that in the next step. First, let's try running that Python script.\n\nUse the Python 3 command to run the script. From the command line, type one of the following:\n\n- `python get-quote.py`\n- `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nYou should see our first quote, the one hard-coded into line 2, printed out in your terminal:\n`Keep it logically awesome.`\n\n## Push your changes\n\nYou've edited your local code, so you have a more recent version than is stored in this repository. You can check that any time by running: `git status`\n\nIt should show one file modified. Every time we want to send our local changes to GitHub, we need to perform three steps:\n\n1. Add the file(s) with changes: `git add get-quote.py`\n2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Hello World\"`\n3. Push the changes: `git push`\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, we'll write some more Python.\n",

Now let's try making some changes...\n\nNotice that the first and last lines of the Python file reference `main()`. That's a Python function and it runs automatically every time you call the script. But only because _we told it to_.\n\nTry changing the name to something else--almost anything, as long as it doesn't have spaces and isn't a [reserved word](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/keywords.html).\n\nMaybe use a synonym of main, such as `primary`.\n\nThe important thing is to change it in _both places_, the first line and the last line.\n\nNow run your code again: `python get-quote.py` or `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nIf you get an error, you might have only changed `main` in one place, or removed the important `()` from after the name. You'd also get an error if you changed that `__main__` thing (line 10), so leave that one be.\n\n## Push your changes\n\nWhen your Python script is running, you'll see the quote again.\n\nTo move on to the next step, push your changes:\n\n- `git add get-quote.py`\n- `git commit -m \"Renamed the primary function\"`\n- `git push`\n\nWhen I see the push come through, I'll share your next steps!\n",

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Now that you've assigned yourself, people who drop by know that they're welcome to participate, but you'll be carrying this issue across the finish line. :sunglasses:.\n\n### Let's use GitHub Pages\n\nNow, on to business! GitHub Pages allow you to serve a static site from a repository. We've filled this repository with some site content, but the rendered site isn't visible right now. Let's change that.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages\n\n1. Click on the [**Settings**](https://github.com/RachhanaBaliga/github-slideshow/settings) tab in this repository\n1. Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section\n1. From the \"Source\" drop down, select **main branch**\n\n> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes. You'll have the opportunity to apply a theme when the course is completed. \n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>\n\n> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

                "body": "\n### :keyboard: Activity: Use fault tolerant approaches to running `tar_make()`\n\nRather than babysitting repeated `tar_make()` calls until all the states build, it's time to adapt our approach to running `tar_make()` when there are steps plagued by network failures. A lot of times, you just need to retry the download/upload again and it will work. This is not always the case though and sometimes, you need to address the failures. The *targets* package does not currently offer this fault tolerance, so the approaches discussed here are designed by our group to provide fault tolerance for tasks such as this data pull (including those where the \"failures\" are all real rather than being largely synthetic as in this project :wink:). \n\n#### Understand your options\n\nThere are a few choices to consider when thinking about fault tolerance in pipelines and they can be separated into two categories - how you want the full pipeline to behave vs. how you want to handle individual targets.  \n\nChoices for handling errors in the full pipeline:\n\n1. You want the pipeline build to come to a grinding hault if any of the targets throw an error.\n2. You want to come back and rebuild the target that is failing but not let that stop other targets from building.\n\nIf you want the first approach, congrats! That's how the pipeline behaves by default and there is no need for you to change anything. If you want the pipeline to keep going but return to build that target later, you should add `error = 'continue'` to your `tar_option_set()` call. \n\nNow let's talk about handling errors for individual targets. There are also a few ideas to consider here.\n\n1. If the target fails, you want that target to return no data and keep going. \n2. If the target fails, you want to retry building that target `n` times (in case of internet flakyness) before ultimately considering it a failed target. \n\nIf you want a failure to still be considered a completed build, then consider implementing `tryCatch` in your download/upload function to gracefully handle errors, return something (e.g. `data.frame()`) from the function, and allow the code to continue. If you want to retry a target before moving on in the pipeline, then we can use the function `retry::retry()`. This is a function from the *retry* package, which you may or may not have installed. Go ahead and check that you have this package before continuing. \n\nWrapping a target `command` with `retry()` will keep building that target until there are no errors OR until it runs out of `max_tries`. You can also set the `when` argument of `retry()` to declare what error message should initiate a rebuild (the input to `when` can be a [regular expression](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions)).\n\n#### Test\n\n- [ ] Add code to load the package *retry* at the top of your *_targets.R* file.\n\n- [ ] Wrap the `get_site_data()` function in your static branching code with `retry()`. The `retry()` function should look for the error message matching `\"Ugh, the internet data transfer failed!\"` and should rerun `get_site_data()` a maximum of 30 times. \n\n- [ ] Now run `tar_make()`. It will redownload data for *all* of the states since we updated the `command` for `nwis_data`. It will take awhile since it is downloading all of them at least once and may need to retry some up to 30 times. Grab a tea or coffee while you wait (~ 10 min) - at least there's no babysitting needed!\n\n#### Commit\n\n- [ ] Commit and push your changes to GitHub. No need to make a PR yet, though; we'll keep working on this issue for a few more minutes first before getting human feedback.\n\nComment once you've committed and pushed your changes to GitHub.\n\n<hr><h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I see your comment.</h3>\n",

Let's get familiar with the files in our repo:\n\n- `README.md`: a markdown introduction to this project\n- `get-quote.py`: the file where we'll write our Python code\n- `quotes.txt`: a text file with a list of quotes\n\nOpen up `get-quote.py` and comment out line 2 by removing the `#` from the beginning of the line. It will look like this:\n```\n  print(\"Keep it logically awesome.\")\n```\n\nThe two spaces (or one tab) in front of the line is important. Python uses whitespace to organize code. This print line is part of the `main()` function. But more on that in the next step. First, let's try running that Python script.\n\nUse the Python 3 command to run the script. From the command line, type one of the following:\n\n- `python get-quote.py`\n- `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nYou should see our first quote, the one hard-coded into line 2, printed out in your terminal:\n`Keep it logically awesome.`\n\n## Push your changes\n\nYou've edited your local code, so you have a more recent version than is stored in this repository. You can check that any time by running: `git status`\n\nIt should show one file modified. Every time we want to send our local changes to GitHub, we need to perform three steps:\n\n1. Add the file(s) with changes: `git add get-quote.py`\n2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Hello World\"`\n3. Push the changes: `git push`\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, we'll write some more Python.\n",

You just need a few things (some of which you might already have!)\n\n- [ ] Check that Python is installed\n- [ ] Check that Git is installed\n- [ ] Clone this repository on your local machine\n\n---\n\n## Check that Python is installed\n\nYour machine may already have Python, or you might need to install it. We also want to check that the right version of Python is present. To find out, go to your command line terminal and type: `python -V`\n\nMake sure to use a capital `-V` or you'll get something very different. If you get an error or have a version less than 3, try this: `python3 -V` (again with the capital `-V`).\n\nIf you see your Python version displayed, you\u2019re all set. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system. Make sure it's Python 3, as previous versions are deprecated.\n\n## Check that Git is installed\n\nWe\u2019ll use a similar approach to find out if you already have git installed. From your comment line, type: `git --version`\n\nIf you see your Git version displayed, you\u2019re good to go. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.\n\n## Clone this repository on your local machine\n\nNow we\u2019re getting to the fun stuff. Let\u2019s clone this repository to your local machine so that we can make some edits:\n`git clone https://github.com/Joal0125/python-random-quote.git`\n\nYou can also download or clone the repo via SSH from the [main repo page](https://github.com/Joal0125/python-random-quote).\n\n## Close this issue to continue\n\nWith your environment ready, let\u2019s get started.\n\nClose this issue and I\u2019ll comment with your next steps!\n",

You just need a few things (some of which you might already have!)\n\n- [ ] Check that Python is installed\n- [ ] Check that Git is installed\n- [ ] Clone this repository on your local machine\n\n---\n\n## Check that Python is installed\n\nYour machine may already have Python, or you might need to install it. We also want to check that the right version of Python is present. To find out, go to your command line terminal and type: `python -V`\n\nMake sure to use a capital `-V` or you'll get something very different. If you get an error or have a version less than 3, try this: `python3 -V` (again with the capital `-V`).\n\nIf you see your Python version displayed, you\u2019re all set. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system. Make sure it's Python 3, as previous versions are deprecated.\n\n## Check that Git is installed\n\nWe\u2019ll use a similar approach to find out if you already have git installed. From your comment line, type: `git --version`\n\nIf you see your Git version displayed, you\u2019re good to go. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.\n\n## Clone this repository on your local machine\n\nNow we\u2019re getting to the fun stuff. Let\u2019s clone this repository to your local machine so that we can make some edits:\n`git clone https://github.com/Joal0125/python-random-quote.git`\n\nYou can also download or clone the repo via SSH from the [main repo page](https://github.com/Joal0125/python-random-quote).\n\n## Close this issue to continue\n\nWith your environment ready, let\u2019s get started.\n\nClose this issue and I\u2019ll comment with your next steps!\n",

Millions of open source repositories on GitHub are public, too!\n\nLicenses, code of conduct, and other files are important when you create a public repository. There are many benefits to this, but it's also a large responsibility. Keep in mind that once a repository is public _and_ open source, there are certain implications about keeping it public, depending on the license chosen.\n\n> It's important to note that public does **not** equal open source!

For example, you could be working in repositories with a lot of history, many collaborators, or many files.\n\nBefore you take this course, you may want to go through the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on Learning Lab.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to do lots of things, like:\n\n- Find relevant issues and pull requests\n- Search history to find context\n- Make connections within GitHub to help others find things\n\n### Cross-linking issues and pull requests\n\nGitHub has special capabilities to help reference other information on GitHub. For example, when you reference another issue or pull request by number, that number will be hyperlinked. At the same time, a cross-reference is created in the linked issue or pull request. This two-way reference helps people track the relationship of information across GitHub.\n\n![a screenshot of an issue linking to a PR, and a PR with a cross-reference to the issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/67594663-d9710900-f732-11e9-8df8-d3173d952bd5.png)\n\n## Step 1: Find an issue\n\nBelow, you will see a reference to another issue. The other issue references _this_ issue. The other issue appears to be a duplicate, so it would be a good idea to close it.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Find and close the cross-linked issue\n\n1. Navigate to the other issue referenced from this issue\n2. Close that issue\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I will respond with your next steps in that issue.</h3>\n",

                "body": "So far we've implemented *split* and *apply* operations; now it's time to explore *combine* operations in **targets** pipelines.\n\nIn this issue you'll add two *combiners* to serve different purposes - the first will combine all of the annual observation tallies into one giant table, and the second will summarize the set of state-specific timeseries plots generated by the task table. \n\n### Background\n\n#### Approach\n\nGiven your current level of knowledge, if you were asked to add a target combining the tally outputs you would likely add a call to `tar_target` and use the branches as input to a `command` that aggregated the data. While this would certainly work, the number of inputs to a combiner should change if the number of tasks changes. If we hand-coded a combiner target with `tar_target` that accepted a set of inputs (e.g., `tar_target(combined_tallies, combine_tallies(tally_WI, tally_MI, [etc]))`), we'd need to manually edit the inputs to that function anytime we changed the `states` vector. That would be a pain and would make our pipeline susceptible to human error if we forgot or made a mistake in that editing. \n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe **targets** way to use combiners for static branching is to work with the `tar_combine()` function (recall that **combiners** are automatically applied to the output in dynamic branching). `tar_combine()` is set up in a similar way to `tar_target()`, where you supply the target name and a function to the target as the `command`. The difference is that the input to the `command` will be multiple targets passed in to the `...` argument. The output from a `tar_combine()` can be an R object or a file, but file targets need to have `format = \"file\"` passed in to `tar_combine()` and the function used as `command` must return the filepath.  \n\nSome additional implementation considerations:\n\n* In order to use `tar_combine()` with the output from `tar_map()`, you will need to save the output of `tar_map()` as an object. Thus, the branching declaration should look something like `mapped_output <- tar_map()` so that `mapped_output` can be used in your `tar_combine()` call.\n\n* You can write your own combiner function or you can use built-in combiner functions for common types of combining (such as `bind_rows()`, `c()`, etc). If you write your own combiner function, it needs to be in a script sourced in the makefile using `source()`. The default combiner is `?vctrs::vec_c`, which is a a fancy version of `c()` that ensures the resulting vector keeps the common data type (e.g. factors remain factors).\n\n* When you pass the output of `tar_map()` to `tar_combine()`, all branch output from `tar_map()` will be used by default. If you had multiple steps in your `tar_map()` (i.e. multiple calls to `tar_target()`), and you only want to combine results from one of those, you can add `unlist = FALSE` to your `tar_map()` call so that the `tar_map()` output remained in a nested list. This makes it possible to reference just the output from each `tar_target()` and use in `tar_combine()`. For example, if you had three steps in your `tap_map()` call and you wanted to combine only those branches from the third step that had a target name of `sum_resuts`, you could use `mapped_output[[3]]` or `mapped_output$sum_results` as the input to `tar_combine()`. \n\n* Within your `tar_combine()` function, pass the `...` to your `command` function by specifying `!!!.x` in its place. It feels strange, but has to do with how the function handles non-standard evaluation. You can see an example of using this syntax when you look at the default for `command` in thehelp file for `?tarchetypes::tar_combine()`.\n\n* When specifying the `command` argument to `tar_combine()`, you need to include the argument, e.g. `command = my_function()`. Since `tar_combine()` has `...` as its second argument, anything else you pass in without the argument name will be considered part of `...`. It can result in some weird errors.\n\nDon't worry if not all of this clicked yet. We are about to see it all in action!\n",

Now that you have a branch, it\u2019s time to create a file and make your first commit!\n\n<details><summary>Commits 101</summary>\n\n## Commits 101\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the \"Commit new file\" section.\n\nIn the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.\n\n### Rules to live by for commit messages:\n\n- Don\u2019t end your commit message with a period.\n- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.\n- Use active voice. For example, \"add\" instead of \"added\" and \"merge\" instead of \"merged\".\n- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.\n\n\n1. Create a new file on this branch, in a `_posts` folder called `0000-01-02-omm17.md`. You can do so using [this shortcut](https://github.com/omm17/github-slideshow/new/new-branch?filename=_posts/0000-01-02-omm17.md) or manually as follows:\n      - Return to the \"Code\" tab\n      - In the branch drop-down, select \"new-branch\"\n      - Click **Create new file**\n      - In the \"file name\" field, type `_posts/0000-01-02-omm17.md`. Entering the `/` in the filename will automatically place your file in the `_posts` directory.\n1. When you\u2019re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:\n      ```yaml\n      ---\n      layout: slide\n      title: \"Welcome to our second slide!\"\n      ---\n      Your text\n      Use the left arrow to go back!\n      ```\n1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the **Commits 101** drop-down, just above these instructions\n1. When you\u2019ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors when branches are only active for a few days before they\u2019re merged <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge)</sup> into the `main` branch.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch\n\n\n\n1.

With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Now that you have a branch, it\u2019s time to create a file and make your first commit!\n\n<details><summary>Commits 101</summary>\n\n## Commits 101\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the \"Commit new file\" section.\n\nIn the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.\n\n### Rules to live by for commit messages:\n\n- Don\u2019t end your commit message with a period.\n- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.\n- Use active voice. For example, \"add\" instead of \"added\" and \"merge\" instead of \"merged\".\n- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.\n\n\n1. Create a new file on this branch, in a `_posts` folder called `0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md`. You can do so using [this shortcut](https://github.com/NIKHIL-RAJIV/github-slideshow/new/slideshow?filename=_posts/0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md) or manually as follows:\n      - Return to the \"Code\" tab\n      - In the branch drop-down, select \"slideshow\"\n      - Click **Create new file**\n      - In the \"file name\" field, type `_posts/0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md`. Entering the `/` in the filename will automatically place your file in the `_posts` directory.\n1. When you\u2019re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:\n      ```yaml\n      ---\n      layout: slide\n      title: \"Welcome to our second slide!\"\n      ---\n      Your text\n      Use the left arrow to go back!\n      ```\n1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the **Commits 101** drop-down, just above these instructions\n1. When you\u2019ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix.

                "body": "## Step 2: Prepare the project\n\n### Working with Binary files\n\nIn general, there are two types of files: text files and binary files.\n\nText files, like most code files, are easily tracked with Git and are very lightweight.\n\nHowever, binary files like spreadsheets, presentations with slides, and videos don't work well with Git. If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines.

Try changing some of that. You could, for example, change the icon that displays when the action is running.\n- Change the `MY_NAME` environment variable to use your name instead of Mona's in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.\n- Change the contents of `entrypoint.sh` to output a different message.\n\nOutside of this repository:\n\n- Review the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions) on the GitHub Developer site.\n- Use existing actions from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions).\n- Use existing actions from GitHub's [official actions community](https://github.com/actions).\n- Use actions created by others in [awesome-actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions).\n\nNow...[what will you learn next](https://lab.github.com/courses)?\n",

                "body": "## Step 1: Planning the move\n\nUploading your project to GitHub gives you the feature-rich tools and collaboration needed to elevate your project to the next level. Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @julimurphy since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update!

If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue.

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @justWeverton since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update!

If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue.

You can format words as **bold** or _italic_, add images, and create lists. Markdown is regular text combined with a few non-alphabetic symbols, such as `#` or `*`. You can use Markdown with the formatting toolbar in issues <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issues)</sup> and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>, or you can type the syntax.\n\nYou can use Markdown most places around GitHub:\n\n- Comments in issues and pull requests (like this one!)\n- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension\n- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists)\n\nFor more information, see \u201c[Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)\u201d in the _GitHub Help_.\n\nLet's get started!\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @justWeverton since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

This is called an \u201c@mention\u201d, because you\u2019re mentioning the individual. You can also `@mention` teams within an organization. For more information, see \u201c[Receiving notifications about activity on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/) in the *GitHub Help*.\n\n  ```\n  @githubteacher\n  ```\n\n  @githubteacher\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Cross Links</summary>\n\n  ### Cross Links\n\n  To bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within a repository, type `#`. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.\n\n  Additionally, references to issues and pull requests are automatically converted to shortened links to the issue or pull request. For example,\n\n  | Reference type | Raw reference | Short link |\n  | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |\n  | Issue or pull request URL | `https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602` | [#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `#` and issue or pull request number | #3602 | [#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `GH-` and issue or pull request number | GH-3602 | [GH-3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `Username/Repository#` and issue or pull request number | desktop/desktop#3602 | [desktop/desktop#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n\n  For more information, see \u201c[Autolinked references and URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/)\u201d in the *GitHub Help*.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Linking Specific Commits</summary>\n\n  ### Linking Specific Commits\n\n  References to a commit's ID (commonly called a SHA or hash) are automatically converted into shortened links to the commit on GitHub. For example,\n\n  | Reference type | Raw reference | Short link |\n  | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |\n  | Commit URL | https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | SHA | 8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | User@SHA | desktop@8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [desktop@8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | Username/Repository@SHA | User/Repository@SHA: desktop/desktop@8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [desktop/desktop@8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87)|\n\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Formatting Markdown\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Quotes</summary>\n\n  ### Quotes\n\n  You can create quote text with a `>`.\n\n  ```\n  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:\n\n  > Pardon my French\n  ```\n\n  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:\n\n  > Pardon my French\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Tables</summary>\n\n   ### Tables\n\n   You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n    ```\n    First Header | Second Header\n    ------------ | -------------\n    Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\n    Content in the first column | Content in the second column\n    ```\n\n  First Header | Second Header\n  ------------ | -------------\n  Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\n  Content in the first column | Content in the second column\n\n  For more detail on formatting with tables, see \"Organizing information with tables\" in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Inline Code Blocks</summary>\n\n  ### Inline Code Blocks\n\n  Certain words and phrases need to be formatted in monospace fonts, especially when writing about code. As you've seen throughout this lab, words can be distinguished in markdown with `inline code blocks`.\n\n  Inline code is just one ``` character on either side of the text, and can be used within paragraphs, headers, or other Markdown.\n\n  ```\n  `inline code is just one backtick`\n  ```\n\n  `inline code is just one backtick`\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Separate Code Blocks</summary>\n\n  ### Separate Code Blocks\n\n  To separate out a larger block of code, use three ``` characters instead of one, and set the text aside in its own paragraph.\n\n  What we type:\n  \n    ```\n    Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:\n    ```\n    \n  What we see:\n  \n  ```\n  Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:\n   ```\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Syntax Highlighting</summary>\n\n  ### Syntax Highlighting\n\n  In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as Javascript or command-line text.\n\n  What we type:\n\n      ```sh\n      github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository\n      $ git init\n      Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/\n      ```\n\n  What we see:\n  ```sh\n  github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository\n  $ git init\n  Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/\n  ```\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Summary dropdown</summary>\n\n  ### Summary dropdown\n\n  Most of the text in this issue is formatted in collapsible summary blocks. Here's how to make them with Markdown:\n\n  ```\n  <details>\n    <summary>Title</summary>\n\n    Content here\n\n  </details>\n  ```\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\nWant to keep learning?

You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "Nice, you just added an action block to your workflow file! Here are some important details about _why_ each part of the block exists and _what_ each part does.\n\n- `jobs:` is the base component of a workflow run\n- `build:` is the identifier we're attaching to this job\n- `name:` is the name of the job, this is displayed on GitHub when the workflow is running\n- `runs-on:` defines the type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner.\n- `steps:` the linear sequence of operations that make up a job\n- `uses: actions/checkout@v1` uses a community action called [`checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to allow the workflow to access the contents of the repository\n- `uses: ./action-a` provides the relative path to the action we created in the `action-a` directory of the repository\n- `with`: is used to specify the input variables that will be available to your action in the runtime environment. In this case, the input variable is `MY_NAME`, and it is currently initialized to `\"Mona\"`.\n\n### Your action has been triggered!\n\nYour repository now contains an action (defined in the `/action-a/` folder) and a workflow (defined in the `./github/workflows/main.yml` file).\n\nThis action will run any time a new commit is created or pushed to the remote repository. Since you just created a commit, the workflow should have been triggered. This might take a few minutes since it's the first time running in this repository.\n\n### Seeing your Action in action\n\nThe status of your action is shown here in the pull request (look for **All checks have passed** below), or you can click the \"Actions\" tab in your repository. From there you will see the actions that have run, and you can click on the action's \"Log\" link to view details.\n\n![View an action's log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/62388049-4e64e600-b52a-11e9-8bf5-db0c5452360f.png)\n\n## Step 6: Trigger the workflow\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: See your action trigger the workflow\n\nYou've done the work, now sit back and see your action trigger the workflow!\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I will respond when I detect your action has run and reported a status.</h3>\n\n> _Actions can take a minute or two to run. Sometimes, I also respond too fast for the page to update! If you don't see a response from your action, wait a few seconds and refresh the page._\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

This name appears on any pull request or in the Actions tab. The name is especially useful when there are multiple workflows in your repository.\n- `on: push` indicates that your workflow will execute anytime code is pushed to your repository, using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.\n\nNext, we need to specify a job or jobs to run.\n\n### Actions\n\nWorkflows piece together jobs, and jobs piece together steps. We'll now create a job that runs an action. Actions can be used from within the same repository, from any other public repository, or from a published Docker container image. We'll use an action that we'll define in this repository.\n\nWe'll add the block now, and break it down in the next step.\n\n## Step 5: Run an action from your workflow file\n\nLet's add the expected action to the workflow.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Add an action block to your workflow file\n\n1. As a part of this branch and pull request, [edit `.github/workflows/main.yml`](https://github.com/shayanimam/hello-github-actions/edit/first-action/.github/workflows/main.yml?pr=/shayanimam/hello-github-actions/pull/2) to append the following content:\n   ```yaml\n   jobs:\n     build:\n       name: Hello world action\n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n       steps:\n         - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n         - uses: ./action-a\n           with:\n             MY_NAME: \"Mona\"\n   ```\n1. Click **Start commit** in the top right of the workflow editor\n1. Type your commit message and commit your changes directly to your branch\n\n<details><summary>Trouble pushing?</summary>\n\nThe `main.yml` file cannot be edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.\n\nIt is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:\n\n```shell\nTo https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git\n ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.yml)\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'\n```\n\n</details>\n<br />\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "Let's add some flavor to our responses, dependent on how we roll. We can do this by using conditionals. We'll put a command that only triggers if a certain condition is met. For example, let's add \"Critical Fail\" in the printed statement if the die roll is a one.\n\nIn Python, we can set this as the criteria by replacing our print statement in the loop with:\n\n```python\nif roll == 1:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n```\n\nBut what if it's *not* a one? We need a catch-all for all the other conditions it could be. This is done in Python with the `else` command. Below our `if` statement and the related print function, add an `else` statement:\n\n```python\nelse:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\n```\n    \nNow we have two different statements that can be printed. Try running your code until you have a roll that is a one and a roll that is something else.\n\nIf we have additional conditions we want to add, we can use a third type of conditional in Python: `elif`. This is used for a specific condition after `if` has been used. Try adding this `elif` statement between the `if` and `else` statements:\n\n```python\nelif roll == 6:\n  print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n```\n\nWith the conditionals added, your main function should look something like this:\n\n```python\ndice_rolls = 2\ndice_sum = 0\nfor i in range(0,dice_rolls):\n  roll = random.randint(1,6)\n  dice_sum += roll\n  if roll == 1:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n  elif roll == 6:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n  else:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\nprint(f'You have rolled a total of {dice_sum}')\n```\n\nLeave a comment with the *number of rolls* it took to get a Critical Success.

                "body": "Wow, 3 rolls?!\n\n## Adding User Input\n\nWe have a working dice roller right now! It's useful for a very specific situation: rolling two six-sided dice. What if we want to change the number of dice we roll? We can manually edit the code each time, but there's a better way to do this: adding a user `input`.\n\nInstead of having `dice_rolls` set to a specific value, let's set it equal to:\n```python\nint(input('How many dice would you like to roll? '))\n```\n\nRunning the code will give a prompt with that question and we can input our desired number of dice. One thing to note: the value a user inputs defaults to a `str` type and we need it to be a whole number, or an `int` in Python; that's why we encompass the `input` command in an `int()`. Try it out!\n\nTabletop games use dice with all number of sides so it'll be useful to add a user input for that too. Below where you set `dice_rolls` add this line:\n\n```python\ndice_size = int(input('How many sides are the dice? '))\n```\n\nChange the max value of our roll like this\n```python\nroll = random.randint(1,dice_size)\n```\n\nWhen changing a value we had assumed to be a specific number previously, we need to make sure the rest of our code still makes sense.  All dice start with one, so our `if` statement regarding one still makes sense. Our `elif` statement regarding six doesn't though, as it is no longer guaranteed to be the highest number. Let's make it so our \"Critical Success\" line is printed to whatever the highest number of our desired dice is. The highest number a dice can roll is the same as the number of sides, so we just to replace our `elif` statement with:\n\n```python\nelif roll == dice_size:\n```\n\nTry it out! Now you can manually input the number of dice and number of sides on the dice knowing that the `Critical Success!` line will realign accordingly. \n\nYour final main function should look like this:\n\n```python\nimport random\ndice_rolls = int(input('How many dice would you like to roll? '))\ndice_size = int(input('How many sides are the dice? '))\ndice_sum = 0\nfor i in range(0,dice_rolls):\n  roll = random.randint(1,dice_size)\n  dice_sum += roll\n  if roll == 1:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Fail')\n  elif roll == dice_size:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}! Critical Success!')\n  else:\n    print(f'You rolled a {roll}')\nprint(f'You have rolled a total of {dice_sum}')\n```\n\n**Push your code** to GitHub to continue:\n```\ngit add dice_roller.py\ngit commit -m \"Tutorial complete\"\ngit push\n```",

                "body": "Now we're ready to really build our quote bot. To test things out, we'll read all the quotes from a file and print the first one.\n\nFirst, you can remove our test quote, the print statement on line 2. You can either comment it out by adding a `#` at the start of the line, or remove it completely.\n\nNext, remove the other comments by deleting `#` from the start of the other four lines to get Python code like this:\n\n```\n  f = open(\"quotes.txt\")\n  quotes = f.readlines()\n  f.close()\n\n  print(quotes)\n```\n\nHere we are opening the `quotes.txt` file, reading all the lines into a new _variable_ called `quotes`, then closing the file (defined by the variable `f`). Finally, we print out the quotes.\n\nYou can run this code and we'll get a dump of _all_ the quotes in the quotes file. That's because Python stored them all in an _array_, which is a single variable that holds a list of values.\n\n## Print the first element of an array\n\nSince we only want one quote, we need to edit our code to print only the first value in the `quotes` array.\n\nIn your code, find the print line and add this special modifier `[0]` so that the line now reads:\n`  print(quotes[0])`\n\nThe square brackets tell Python that we want a specific item in the array. Since it starts counting at zero, we've grabbed the first item.\n\n## Comment with the first quote\n\nRun your code and copy the value to your clipboard.\n\nPaste the quote as a comment here and I'll follow up with next steps!\n",

                "body": "You've just run a fully functioning pipeline with 212 unique branches (53 states x 4 steps)! Imagine if you had coded that with a `for` loop and just one of those states threw an error? :grimacing:\n\nNow that you have your pipeline running with static branching, let's try to convert it into the other type of branching, dynamic. \n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Switch to dynamic branching\n\nIn our scenario, it doesn't matter too much whether we pick static or dynamic branching. Both can work for us. I chose to show you static first because inspecting and building pipelines with dynamic branching can be more mysterious. In dynamic branching, the naming given to each branch target is assigned randomly and dynamic branch targets do not appear in the diagram produced by `tar_visnetwork()`. But despite those inconveniences, dynamic branching is needed in many situations in order to build truly robust pipelines, so here we go ...\n\n#### Convert to dynamic branching\n\n- [ ] First, let's drop back down to just a few states while we get this new branching set up. Change to `states <- c('WI', 'MN', 'MI')` and run `tar_destroy()` to reset our pipeline (note: use `tar_destroy()` very sparingly and deliberately, as it wipes all previous pipeline builds).\n\n- [ ] We no longer need to use `tar_map()` to create a separate object containing our static branching output. In dynamic branching, we just add to individual `tar_target()` calls. We will move each of the four targets from `tar_map()` into the appropriate targets list individually. First, move your \"splitter\" target `nwis_inventory` into your list of targets just after `oldest_active_sites`.\n\n- [ ] Let's adjust this target to follow dynamic branching concepts. In dynamic branching, the output of each target is always combined back into a single object. So, `filter()`ing this dataset by state is not actually going to do anything. Instead of splitting the data apart by a branching variable (remember we used `tibble(state_abb = states)`?) as we do in static branching, we will use the `state_cd` column from `oldest_active_sites` as a grouping variable in preparation of subsequent targets that will be applied over those groups. You need to then add a special *targets* grouping (`tar_group()`) for it to be treated appropriately. Lastly, the default \"iteration\" in dynamic branching is by list, but we just set it up to use groups, so we need to change that. In the end, your \"splitter\" target should look like this:\n\n  ```r\n  tar_target(nwis_inventory,\n            oldest_active_sites %>%\n             group_by(state_cd) %>%\n             tar_group(),\n           iteration = \"group\")\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Now to download the data! Copy your `tar_target()` code for the `nwis_data` target and paste as a target after your `nwis_inventory` target. Make two small changes: replace `state_abb` with `nwis_inventory$state_cd` & add `pattern = map(nwis_inventory)` as an argument to `tar_target()`. This second part is what turns this into a dynamic branching target. It will apply the `retry(get_site_data())` call to each of the groups we defined in `nwis_inventory`. Continuing this idea, we can still get the state abbreviation to pass to `get_site_data()` by using the `state_cd` column from `nwis_inventory`. Since we grouped by `state_cd`, this will only have the one value.\n\n- [ ] Add the tallying step. Copy the `tar_target()` code for the `tally` target into your targets list. Add `pattern = map(nwis_data)` as the final argument to `tar_target()` to set that up to dynamically branch based on the same branching from the `nwis_data` target. \n\n- [ ] Since dynamic branching automatically combines the output into a single object, the `tally` target already represents the combined tallies per state. We no longer need `obs_tallies`! Delete that target :) Make sure you update the downstream targets that dependend on `obs_tallies` and have them use `tally` instead (just `data_coverage_png` in our case).\n\n- [ ] We are on our final step to convert to dynamic branching - our timeseries plots. This is a bit trickier because we were using our static branching `values` table to define the PNG filenames, but now won't have available to us. Instead, we will build them as part of our argument directly in the function. First, copy the target code for `timeseries_png` into the list of targets. Replace `state_plot_files` in the `plot_site_data()` command with the `sprintf()` command used to define `values` in the `tar_map()` command, which creates the string with the filename. Replace `state_abb` with `unique(nwis_data$State)`. Add `pattern = map(nwis_data)` as the final argument to `tar_target`.\n\n- [ ] Once again, dynamic branching will automatically combine the output into a single object. For file targets, that means a vector of the filenames. So, we need to change our `summary_state_timeseries_csv` target to take advantage of that. First, it can be a regular `tar_target()`, so replace `tar_combine()` with `tar_target()`. Next, delete `mapped_by_state_targets$timeseries_png` so that the very next argument to `tar_target()` is the command. Edit the second argument to the command to be `timeseries_png` instead of `!!!.x`. Note that I didn't ask you to add `pattern = map()` to this function. We don't need to add `pattern` here because we want to use the combined target as input, not each individual filename.\n\n- [ ] We need to adjust the function we used in that last target because it was setup to handle the output from a static branching step, not a dynamic one. There are two differences: 1) the static branching output for the filenames was not a single object, but a collection of objects (hence, `...` as our second argument for `summarize_targets()`), and 2) the individual filenames are known by the static branching approach, but only the hashed target names for the files are known in the dynamic branching approach. To fix the first difference, go to the `3_summarize/src/summarize_targets.R` file and update the function to accept a vector rather than multiple vectors for the second argument. To fix the second difference, go back to your `_targets.R` file and add `names()` around the input `timeseries_png`. This passes in the targets name for the dynamically created files, not just the filenames. Otherwise, `tar_meta()` won't know what you are talking about. The last note is that *targets* v0.5.0.9000 complains about passing in a vector as \"ambiguous\". You can fix this by wrapping your file vector argument used in `tar_meta()` with `all_of()` in your `summarize_targets()` function to get rid of the message.\n\n- [ ] Clean up! Delete any of the remaining static branching content. Delete the code that creates `mapped_by_state_targets` and make sure that `mapped_by_state_targets` does not appear in the your targets list.\n\n- [ ] Run `tar_visnetwork()` and inspect your pipeline diagram. Do all the steps and dependencies make sense? Do you notice anything that is disconnected from the pipeline? You may have caught this during the previous clean up step, but my pipeline looks like this:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13220910/125475294-edf74bb6-cbbf-41b3-afa5-8373dfdfe3fd.png)\n\nDo you see the function `combine_obs_tallies` in the bottom left that is disconnected from the pipeline? There are a few ways to move forward knowing that something is disconnected: 1) fixing it because it should be connected, 2) leaving it knowing that you will need it in the future, or 3) deleting it because it is no longer needed. We will do the third - go ahead and delete that function. It exists in *2_process/src/tally_site_obs.R*. Re-run `tar_visnetwork()`. It should no longer appear.\n\n#### Test\n\n- [ ] Now run `tar_make()`. Remember that we set this up to use only three states at first. What do you notice in your console as the pipeline builds with respect to target naming?\n\n- [ ] Once your pipeline builds using dynamic branching across three states, change your `states` object back to the full list,\n\n```r\nstates <- c('AL','AZ','AR','CA','CO','CT','DE','DC','FL','GA','ID','IL','IN','IA',\n            'KS','KY','LA','ME','MD','MA','MI','MN','MS','MO','MT','NE','NV','NH',\n            'NJ','NM','NY','NC','ND','OH','OK','OR','PA','RI','SC','SD','TN','TX',\n            'UT','VT','VA','WA','WV','WI','WY','AK','HI','GU','PR')\n```\n\n- [ ] Run `tar_visnetwork()`. Is it the same or different since updating the states?\n\n- [ ] Time to test the full thing! Run `tar_make()`. Since we used `tar_destroy()` between the last full state build and now, it will take awhile (~ 10 min).\n\n#### Commit\n\n- [ ] Commit and push your changes to GitHub. No need to make a PR yet, though; we'll keep working on this issue for a few more minutes first before getting human feedback.\n\nOnce you've committed and pushed your changes to GitHub, comment about some of the differences you notice when running this pipeline using the dynamic branching approach vs our original static branching approach. Include a screenshot of the result in your viewer from your last `tar_visnetwork()` showing your dynamic branching pipeline.\n\n<hr><h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I see your comment.</h3>\n",

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Let's get familiar with the files in our repo:\n\n- `README.md`: a markdown introduction to this project\n- `get-quote.py`: the file where we'll write our Python code\n- `quotes.txt`: a text file with a list of quotes\n\nOpen up `get-quote.py` and comment out line 2 by removing the `#` from the beginning of the line. It will look like this:\n```\n  print(\"Keep it logically awesome.\")\n```\n\nThe two spaces (or one tab) in front of the line is important. Python uses whitespace to organize code. This print line is part of the `main()` function. But more on that in the next step. First, let's try running that Python script.\n\nUse the Python 3 command to run the script. From the command line, type one of the following:\n\n- `python get-quote.py`\n- `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nYou should see our first quote, the one hard-coded into line 2, printed out in your terminal:\n`Keep it logically awesome.`\n\n## Push your changes\n\nYou've edited your local code, so you have a more recent version than is stored in this repository. You can check that any time by running: `git status`\n\nIt should show one file modified. Every time we want to send our local changes to GitHub, we need to perform three steps:\n\n1. Add the file(s) with changes: `git add get-quote.py`\n2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Hello World\"`\n3. Push the changes: `git push`\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, we'll write some more Python.\n",

Now let's try making some changes...\n\nNotice that the first and last lines of the Python file reference `main()`. That's a Python function and it runs automatically every time you call the script. But only because _we told it to_.\n\nTry changing the name to something else--almost anything, as long as it doesn't have spaces and isn't a [reserved word](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/keywords.html).\n\nMaybe use a synonym of main, such as `primary`.\n\nThe important thing is to change it in _both places_, the first line and the last line.\n\nNow run your code again: `python get-quote.py` or `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nIf you get an error, you might have only changed `main` in one place, or removed the important `()` from after the name. You'd also get an error if you changed that `__main__` thing (line 10), so leave that one be.\n\n## Push your changes\n\nWhen your Python script is running, you'll see the quote again.\n\nTo move on to the next step, push your changes:\n\n- `git add get-quote.py`\n- `git commit -m \"Renamed the primary function\"`\n- `git push`\n\nWhen I see the push come through, I'll share your next steps!\n",

Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step.

Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section\n1. From the \"Source\" drop down, select **main branch**\n\n> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes. You'll have the opportunity to apply a theme when the course is completed. \n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>\n\n> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository.

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

A lot of times, you just need to retry the download/upload again and it will work. This is not always the case though and sometimes, you need to address the failures. The *targets* package does not currently offer this fault tolerance, so the approaches discussed here are designed by our group to provide fault tolerance for tasks such as this data pull (including those where the \"failures\" are all real rather than being largely synthetic as in this project :wink:). \n\n#### Understand your options\n\nThere are a few choices to consider when thinking about fault tolerance in pipelines and they can be separated into two categories - how you want the full pipeline to behave vs. how you want to handle individual targets.  \n\nChoices for handling errors in the full pipeline:\n\n1. You want the pipeline build to come to a grinding hault if any of the targets throw an error.\n2. You want to come back and rebuild the target that is failing but not let that stop other targets from building.\n\nIf you want the first approach, congrats! That's how the pipeline behaves by default and there is no need for you to change anything. If you want the pipeline to keep going but return to build that target later, you should add `error = 'continue'` to your `tar_option_set()` call. \n\nNow let's talk about handling errors for individual targets. There are also a few ideas to consider here.\n\n1. If the target fails, you want that target to return no data and keep going. \n2. If the target fails, you want to retry building that target `n` times (in case of internet flakyness) before ultimately considering it a failed target. \n\nIf you want a failure to still be considered a completed build, then consider implementing `tryCatch` in your download/upload function to gracefully handle errors, return something (e.g. `data.frame()`) from the function, and allow the code to continue. If you want to retry a target before moving on in the pipeline, then we can use the function `retry::retry()`. This is a function from the *retry* package, which you may or may not have installed. Go ahead and check that you have this package before continuing. \n\nWrapping a target `command` with `retry()` will keep building that target until there are no errors OR until it runs out of `max_tries`. You can also set the `when` argument of `retry()` to declare what error message should initiate a rebuild (the input to `when` can be a [regular expression](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions)).\n\n#### Test\n\n- [ ] Add code to load the package *retry* at the top of your *_targets.R* file.\n\n- [ ] Wrap the `get_site_data()` function in your static branching code with `retry()`. The `retry()` function should look for the error message matching `\"Ugh, the internet data transfer failed!\"` and should rerun `get_site_data()` a maximum of 30 times. \n\n- [ ] Now run `tar_make()`. It will redownload data for *all* of the states since we updated the `command` for `nwis_data`. It will take awhile since it is downloading all of them at least once and may need to retry some up to 30 times. Grab a tea or coffee while you wait (~ 10 min) - at least there's no babysitting needed!\n\n#### Commit\n\n- [ ] Commit and push your changes to GitHub. No need to make a PR yet, though; we'll keep working on this issue for a few more minutes first before getting human feedback.\n\nComment once you've committed and pushed your changes to GitHub.\n\n<hr><h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I see your comment.</h3>\n",

It will look like this:\n```\n  print(\"Keep it logically awesome.\")\n```\n\nThe two spaces (or one tab) in front of the line is important. Python uses whitespace to organize code. This print line is part of the `main()` function. But more on that in the next step. First, let's try running that Python script.\n\nUse the Python 3 command to run the script. From the command line, type one of the following:\n\n- `python get-quote.py`\n- `python3 get-quote.py`\n\nYou should see our first quote, the one hard-coded into line 2, printed out in your terminal:\n`Keep it logically awesome.`\n\n## Push your changes\n\nYou've edited your local code, so you have a more recent version than is stored in this repository. You can check that any time by running: `git status`\n\nIt should show one file modified. Every time we want to send our local changes to GitHub, we need to perform three steps:\n\n1. Add the file(s) with changes: `git add get-quote.py`\n2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"Hello World\"`\n3. Push the changes: `git push`\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, we'll write some more Python.\n",

Millions of open source repositories on GitHub are public, too!\n\nLicenses, code of conduct, and other files are important when you create a public repository. There are many benefits to this, but it's also a large responsibility. Keep in mind that once a repository is public _and_ open source, there are certain implications about keeping it public, depending on the license chosen.\n\n> It's important to note that public does **not** equal open source!

The following activity provides instructions to move your local project to GitHub using various tools. Select the tool you are most comfortable with and get importing :smile:.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Moving your local project\n\n1. In the **Code** tab of this repository, copy the URL shown under **Quick Setup**.\n1. Follow the instructions below based on what tool you'd like to use locally.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Using the command line</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Using the command line\n\n  1. In your command line, navigate to your project directory. Type `git init` to initialize the directory as a Git repository.\n  2. Type `git remote add origin https://github.com/justWeverton/github-upload.git`\n  3. Type `git add .`\n  4. Type `git commit -m \"initializing repository\"`\n  5. Type `git push -u origin main` to push the files you have locally to the remote on GitHub. (You may be asked to log in.)\n\n  **Note:** You can also use a password protected SSH key to connect to GitHub. See [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) in our documentation to learn more.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Using GitHub Desktop</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Using GitHub Desktop\n\nGitHub Desktop doesn't allow you to add a new remote for an existing directory, so instead we'll copy the contents of your existing folder to our repo. If you'd like to keep your existing folder, you may want to use the command line or one of the other tools.\n\n  1. In GitHub Desktop, click on **File** and **Clone a repository**.\n  2. Click on the **URL** tab.\n  3. Paste the URL from this repository.\n  4. Move the contents of your local repository to this directory.\n  5. Create a commit by entering a commit message and then clicking on **Commit to main**\n  6.

The following activity provides instructions to move your local project to GitHub using various tools. Select the tool you are most comfortable with and get importing :smile:.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Moving your local project\n\n1. In the **Code** tab of this repository, copy the URL shown under **Quick Setup**.\n1.

For example, you could be working in repositories with a lot of history, many collaborators, or many files.\n\nBefore you take this course, you may want to go through the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on Learning Lab.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to do lots of things, like:\n\n- Find relevant issues and pull requests\n- Search history to find context\n- Make connections within GitHub to help others find things\n\n### Cross-linking issues and pull requests\n\nGitHub has special capabilities to help reference other information on GitHub. For example, when you reference another issue or pull request by number, that number will be hyperlinked. At the same time, a cross-reference is created in the linked issue or pull request. This two-way reference helps people track the relationship of information across GitHub.\n\n![a screenshot of an issue linking to a PR, and a PR with a cross-reference to the issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/67594663-d9710900-f732-11e9-8df8-d3173d952bd5.png)\n\n## Step 1: Find an issue\n\nBelow, you will see a reference to another issue. The other issue references _this_ issue. The other issue appears to be a duplicate, so it would be a good idea to close it.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Find and close the cross-linked issue\n\n1. Navigate to the other issue referenced from this issue\n2. Close that issue\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I will respond with your next steps in that issue.</h3>\n",

                "body": "So far we've implemented *split* and *apply* operations; now it's time to explore *combine* operations in **targets** pipelines.\n\nIn this issue you'll add two *combiners* to serve different purposes - the first will combine all of the annual observation tallies into one giant table, and the second will summarize the set of state-specific timeseries plots generated by the task table. \n\n### Background\n\n#### Approach\n\nGiven your current level of knowledge, if you were asked to add a target combining the tally outputs you would likely add a call to `tar_target` and use the branches as input to a `command` that aggregated the data. While this would certainly work, the number of inputs to a combiner should change if the number of tasks changes. If we hand-coded a combiner target with `tar_target` that accepted a set of inputs (e.g., `tar_target(combined_tallies, combine_tallies(tally_WI, tally_MI, [etc]))`), we'd need to manually edit the inputs to that function anytime we changed the `states` vector. That would be a pain and would make our pipeline susceptible to human error if we forgot or made a mistake in that editing. \n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe **targets** way to use combiners for static branching is to work with the `tar_combine()` function (recall that **combiners** are automatically applied to the output in dynamic branching). `tar_combine()` is set up in a similar way to `tar_target()`, where you supply the target name and a function to the target as the `command`. The difference is that the input to the `command` will be multiple targets passed in to the `...` argument. The output from a `tar_combine()` can be an R object or a file, but file targets need to have `format = \"file\"` passed in to `tar_combine()` and the function used as `command` must return the filepath.  \n\nSome additional implementation considerations:\n\n* In order to use `tar_combine()` with the output from `tar_map()`, you will need to save the output of `tar_map()` as an object. Thus, the branching declaration should look something like `mapped_output <- tar_map()` so that `mapped_output` can be used in your `tar_combine()` call.\n\n* You can write your own combiner function or you can use built-in combiner functions for common types of combining (such as `bind_rows()`, `c()`, etc). If you write your own combiner function, it needs to be in a script sourced in the makefile using `source()`. The default combiner is `?vctrs::vec_c`, which is a a fancy version of `c()` that ensures the resulting vector keeps the common data type (e.g. factors remain factors).\n\n* When you pass the output of `tar_map()` to `tar_combine()`, all branch output from `tar_map()` will be used by default. If you had multiple steps in your `tar_map()` (i.e. multiple calls to `tar_target()`), and you only want to combine results from one of those, you can add `unlist = FALSE` to your `tar_map()` call so that the `tar_map()` output remained in a nested list. This makes it possible to reference just the output from each `tar_target()` and use in `tar_combine()`. For example, if you had three steps in your `tap_map()` call and you wanted to combine only those branches from the third step that had a target name of `sum_resuts`, you could use `mapped_output[[3]]` or `mapped_output$sum_results` as the input to `tar_combine()`. \n\n* Within your `tar_combine()` function, pass the `...` to your `command` function by specifying `!!!.x` in its place. It feels strange, but has to do with how the function handles non-standard evaluation. You can see an example of using this syntax when you look at the default for `command` in thehelp file for `?tarchetypes::tar_combine()`.\n\n* When specifying the `command` argument to `tar_combine()`, you need to include the argument, e.g. `command = my_function()`. Since `tar_combine()` has `...` as its second argument, anything else you pass in without the argument name will be considered part of `...`. It can result in some weird errors.\n\nDon't worry if not all of this clicked yet. We are about to see it all in action!\n",

Now that you have a branch, it\u2019s time to create a file and make your first commit!\n\n<details><summary>Commits 101</summary>\n\n## Commits 101\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the \"Commit new file\" section.\n\nIn the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.\n\n### Rules to live by for commit messages:\n\n- Don\u2019t end your commit message with a period.\n- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.\n- Use active voice. For example, \"add\" instead of \"added\" and \"merge\" instead of \"merged\".\n- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.\n\n\n1. Create a new file on this branch, in a `_posts` folder called `0000-01-02-omm17.md`. You can do so using [this shortcut](https://github.com/omm17/github-slideshow/new/new-branch?filename=_posts/0000-01-02-omm17.md) or manually as follows:\n      - Return to the \"Code\" tab\n      - In the branch drop-down, select \"new-branch\"\n      - Click **Create new file**\n      - In the \"file name\" field, type `_posts/0000-01-02-omm17.md`. Entering the `/` in the filename will automatically place your file in the `_posts` directory.\n1. When you\u2019re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:\n      ```yaml\n      ---\n      layout: slide\n      title: \"Welcome to our second slide!\"\n      ---\n      Your text\n      Use the left arrow to go back!\n      ```\n1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the **Commits 101** drop-down, just above these instructions\n1. When you\u2019ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

Where issues encourage discussion with other contributors and collaborators on a project, pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until they\u2019re perfect!\n\n<details><summary>What is a pull request?</summary>\n\n## Pull requests\n\nLet\u2019s think back to the GitHub flow again. You have created a branch, added a file, and committed the file to your branch. Now it\u2019s time to collaborate on your file with other students taking this class. This collaboration happens in a pull request. Check out this video to learn more:\n\n:tv: [Video: Introduction to pull requests](https://youtu.be/kJr-PIfLDl4)\n<hr>\n</details>\n\nThis pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` branch.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request\n\n1. Open a pull request using [this shortcut](https://github.com/NIKHIL-RAJIV/github-slideshow/compare/refs/heads/my-slide?expand=1) or manually as follows:\n    - From the \"Pull requests\" tab, click **New pull request**\n    - In the \"base:\" drop-down menu, make sure the \"main\" branch is selected\n    - In the \"compare:\" drop-down menu, select \"my-slide\"\n1. When you\u2019ve selected your branch, enter a title for your pull request. For example `Add NIKHIL-RAJIV's file`\n1. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Feel free to add a description of what you\u2019ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a branch, created a file and made a commit, and opened a pull request\n1. Click **Create pull request**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in your new pull request.</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.\n\n### Tips for using branches\n\nA single project can have hundreds of branches, each suggesting a new change to the `main` branch.\n\nThe best way to keep branches organized with a team is to keep them concise and short-lived. In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors when branches are only active for a few days before they\u2019re merged <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge)</sup> into the `main` branch.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the [Code tab](https://github.com/Babschiin/github-slideshow)\n2. Click **Branch: main** in the drop-down\n3. In the field, enter a name for your branch, like `my-slide`\n4.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Now that you have a branch, it\u2019s time to create a file and make your first commit!\n\n<details><summary>Commits 101</summary>\n\n## Commits 101\n\nWhen you\u2019re finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the \"Commit new file\" section.\n\nIn the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.\n\n### Rules to live by for commit messages:\n\n- Don\u2019t end your commit message with a period.\n- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.\n- Use active voice. For example, \"add\" instead of \"added\" and \"merge\" instead of \"merged\".\n- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.\n\n\n1. Create a new file on this branch, in a `_posts` folder called `0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md`. You can do so using [this shortcut](https://github.com/NIKHIL-RAJIV/github-slideshow/new/slideshow?filename=_posts/0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md) or manually as follows:\n      - Return to the \"Code\" tab\n      - In the branch drop-down, select \"slideshow\"\n      - Click **Create new file**\n      - In the \"file name\" field, type `_posts/0000-01-02-NIKHIL-RAJIV.md`. Entering the `/` in the filename will automatically place your file in the `_posts` directory.\n1. When you\u2019re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:\n      ```yaml\n      ---\n      layout: slide\n      title: \"Welcome to our second slide!\"\n      ---\n      Your text\n      Use the left arrow to go back!\n      ```\n1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a commit message in the text-entry field below the file edit view. For guidelines on commit messages, check out the **Commits 101** drop-down, just above these instructions\n1. When you\u2019ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.</h3>\n",

Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs.

GitHub Pages allow you to serve a static site from a repository. We've filled this repository with some site content, but the rendered site isn't visible right now. Let's change that.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages\n\n1. Click on the [**Settings**](https://github.com/heiskr/github-slideshow/settings) tab in this repository\n1. Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section\n1. From the \"Source\" drop down, select **main branch**\n\n> Note: Even though you'll see an option to choose a theme, do not apply a theme at this point. We've protected the code so you can't make unintended changes. You'll have the opportunity to apply a theme when the course is completed. \n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I'll respond in this issue when I detect GitHub Pages has deployed your site.</h3>\n\n> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. This reduces confusion among contributors when branches are only active for a few days before they\u2019re merged <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge)</sup> into the `main` branch.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the [Code tab](https://github.com/omm17/github-slideshow)\n2. Click **Branch: main** in the drop-down\n3. In the field, enter a name for your branch, like `my-slide`\n4.

Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5.

                "body": "## Step 2: Prepare the project\n\n### Working with Binary files\n\nIn general, there are two types of files: text files and binary files.\n\nText files, like most code files, are easily tracked with Git and are very lightweight.\n\nHowever, binary files like spreadsheets, presentations with slides, and videos don't work well with Git. If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

                "body": "# :wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's \"Introduction to GitHub\"\n\nTo get started, I\u2019ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\n\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6. Click the **Unwatch** button to disable notifications, or **Watch** to enable them\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Keep reading below to find your first task</h3>\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @julimurphy since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update! If you perform an expected action and don't see a response from me, wait a few seconds and refresh the page for your next steps._\n",

If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @justWeverton since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update!

If your repository already has some of these files, it's best to have a plan in place before you enable Git version control.\n\nYou could choose to remove the binary files, or use another tool like [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git Large File Storage). We won't get into detail on how to set up git-lfs in this course, but we will talk about `.gitignore` files next, which are key to protecting your code from becoming bloated with binaries.\n\n### Add a `.gitignore`\n\nAs we convert your project to a Git repository, it should only include the source code necessary to build or compile your project. In addition to avoiding binaries as we discussed above, you will also want to keep build artifacts out of your version controlled code. \n\nTo do this, you will create a file in your current project named `.gitignore`. Git will use the `.gitignore` to determine which files and directories should not be tracked under version control. The [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) is stored in your repository in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that interact with the repository. \n\nSince the files to be ignored are dependent on the language you are using, the open source community has contributed some great templates for `.gitignore` files in the [`github/gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Prepare your repository\n\n1. Remove any binary files from your repository.\n2. In your local environment, [create a `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/). You can use a [template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) or create your own.\n\n> When you are finished, close this issue. I will open a new issue with the next steps. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close this issue before moving on.\n",

Not to mention, it's also pretty exciting. If you're doing this for the first time, you have a few options when uploading your project to GitHub. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to upload a local project to be hosted on GitHub.\n\nI know some people like to get straight to the point while others like more information. For those who like more information, be sure to check out the drop-downs like this one :arrow_down:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why move to GitHub?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Why move to GitHub?\n\n  You may be wondering what this GitHub thing is all about and why you should use it. If this sounds like you, here are a few reasons to make GitHub your project's new home:\n\n  - **Version control** \u2014 Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git](http://git-scm.com), the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.\n  - **Keep your code in one place** \u2014 Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some important projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.\n  - **Collaboration** \u2014 Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you, share it with the world, or send a link to a friend to help you debug a problem.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Where is your project?\n\nMost users find it is easiest to upload a project that is already located on their local machine, so **the goal of this first step is to make a local copy of the repository.** First, let's make sure this course is going to give you the right steps:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project on another version control system, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Moving your project from another version control system\n\n  If you are moving your project from another version control system, the steps are a bit different that uploading your project from your local machine. Because of this, we have a dedicated course for migrating your project to GitHub.\n\n  If you are moving your project from Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Is your project using version control?</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Is your project using version control\n\n  If you aren't sure whether or not your code is under version control, it probably isn't. However, here are a few tests you can apply to know for certain:\n\n  - Can you view a history of the changes you have made?\n  - Can you easily roll back to a previous version of your project?\n  - Are you required to provide \"messages\" or \"commits\" when you make changes?\n\n  If none of these are true, your project isn't using version control.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Exporting your project\n\nChoose the drop-down below that best fits your current situation.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is already on your local machine</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### Your project is already on your local machine\n\n  :sparkles: Terrific! @justWeverton since you already have the project locally, you are _almost_ ready to move it to GitHub.\n\n  To confirm: You have a project directory on your computer and you want to save it on GitHub.\n\n  - **If this is correct**, close this issue to signal you are finished with this step. I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations.  \n\n  - **If this is incorrect**, please use the next drop-down to learn how to export your project to your local machine or join the [Migrating your project to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/courses/migrating-your-repository-to-github) course to migrate your project to GitHub.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Your project is on a non-version controlled site, such as CodePen or Glitch</summary>\n  <hr>\n\n  ### General instructions\n\n  There are many platforms that allow users to create and store projects. We can't cover them all, but we will do our best to cover the more common examples. First, let's cover general instructions:\n\n  - Export your project using the tools available on the current site. This will usually happen via a .zip, or some other compressed format, downloaded directly to your local machine\n  - Save the .zip file\n  - Extract the .zip file\n\n  Now let's talk about specific platforms:\n\n  #### Exporting from CodePen\n\n  From the main page of your CodePen project:\n\n  1. Click the **Export** button in the bottom right corner\n  2. Save the exported .zip file in your local directory\n  3. Extract the .zip file\n\n  #### Exporting from Glitch\n\n  From your Glitch project page:\n\n  1. Click the dropdown next to your project name in the top right corner\n  1. Select **Advanced Options**\n  1. Select **Download Project**\n  1. Save the exported file in your local directory\n  1. Extract the file\n  1. Rename the `app` folder as desired\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Ready to move on?\n\n**Close this issue to signal you are finished with this step.** I will open a new issue to show you how to optimize your repository for Git operations. :tada:\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response</h3>\n\n> :robot: I'm waiting for you to close the issue before moving on.\n\n> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update! If you perform an expected action and don't see a response from me, wait a few seconds and refresh the page for your next steps._\n",

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3.

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\u2019s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [things you\u2019re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5.

You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

For more information, see \u201c[Receiving notifications about activity on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/) in the *GitHub Help*.\n\n  ```\n  @githubteacher\n  ```\n\n  @githubteacher\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Cross Links</summary>\n\n  ### Cross Links\n\n  To bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within a repository, type `#`. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.\n\n  Additionally, references to issues and pull requests are automatically converted to shortened links to the issue or pull request. For example,\n\n  | Reference type | Raw reference | Short link |\n  | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |\n  | Issue or pull request URL | `https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602` | [#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `#` and issue or pull request number | #3602 | [#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `GH-` and issue or pull request number | GH-3602 | [GH-3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n  | `Username/Repository#` and issue or pull request number | desktop/desktop#3602 | [desktop/desktop#3602](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3602) |\n\n  For more information, see \u201c[Autolinked references and URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/)\u201d in the *GitHub Help*.\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Linking Specific Commits</summary>\n\n  ### Linking Specific Commits\n\n  References to a commit's ID (commonly called a SHA or hash) are automatically converted into shortened links to the commit on GitHub. For example,\n\n  | Reference type | Raw reference | Short link |\n  | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |\n  | Commit URL | https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | SHA | 8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | User@SHA | desktop@8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [desktop@8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87) |\n  | Username/Repository@SHA | User/Repository@SHA: desktop/desktop@8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87 | [desktop/desktop@8304e9c](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/commit/8304e9c271a5e5ab4fda797304cd7bcca7158c87)|\n\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Formatting Markdown\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Quotes</summary>\n\n  ### Quotes\n\n  You can create quote text with a `>`.\n\n  ```\n  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:\n\n  > Pardon my French\n  ```\n\n  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:\n\n  > Pardon my French\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Tables</summary>\n\n   ### Tables\n\n   You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n    ```\n    First Header | Second Header\n    ------------ | -------------\n    Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\n    Content in the first column | Content in the second column\n    ```\n\n  First Header | Second Header\n  ------------ | -------------\n  Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\n  Content in the first column | Content in the second column\n\n  For more detail on formatting with tables, see \"Organizing information with tables\" in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Inline Code Blocks</summary>\n\n  ### Inline Code Blocks\n\n  Certain words and phrases need to be formatted in monospace fonts, especially when writing about code. As you've seen throughout this lab, words can be distinguished in markdown with `inline code blocks`.\n\n  Inline code is just one ``` character on either side of the text, and can be used within paragraphs, headers, or other Markdown.\n\n  ```\n  `inline code is just one backtick`\n  ```\n\n  `inline code is just one backtick`\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Separate Code Blocks</summary>\n\n  ### Separate Code Blocks\n\n  To separate out a larger block of code, use three ``` characters instead of one, and set the text aside in its own paragraph.\n\n  What we type:\n  \n    ```\n    Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:\n    ```\n    \n  What we see:\n  \n  ```\n  Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:\n   ```\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Syntax Highlighting</summary>\n\n  ### Syntax Highlighting\n\n  In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as Javascript or command-line text.\n\n  What we type:\n\n      ```sh\n      github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository\n      $ git init\n      Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/\n      ```\n\n  What we see:\n  ```sh\n  github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository\n  $ git init\n  Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/\n  ```\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Summary dropdown</summary>\n\n  ### Summary dropdown\n\n  Most of the text in this issue is formatted in collapsible summary blocks. Here's how to make them with Markdown:\n\n  ```\n  <details>\n    <summary>Title</summary>\n\n    Content here\n\n  </details>\n  ```\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\nWant to keep learning?

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "Nice, you just added an action block to your workflow file! Here are some important details about _why_ each part of the block exists and _what_ each part does.\n\n- `jobs:` is the base component of a workflow run\n- `build:` is the identifier we're attaching to this job\n- `name:` is the name of the job, this is displayed on GitHub when the workflow is running\n- `runs-on:` defines the type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner.\n- `steps:` the linear sequence of operations that make up a job\n- `uses: actions/checkout@v1` uses a community action called [`checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to allow the workflow to access the contents of the repository\n- `uses: ./action-a` provides the relative path to the action we created in the `action-a` directory of the repository\n- `with`: is used to specify the input variables that will be available to your action in the runtime environment. In this case, the input variable is `MY_NAME`, and it is currently initialized to `\"Mona\"`.\n\n### Your action has been triggered!\n\nYour repository now contains an action (defined in the `/action-a/` folder) and a workflow (defined in the `./github/workflows/main.yml` file).\n\nThis action will run any time a new commit is created or pushed to the remote repository. Since you just created a commit, the workflow should have been triggered. This might take a few minutes since it's the first time running in this repository.\n\n### Seeing your Action in action\n\nThe status of your action is shown here in the pull request (look for **All checks have passed** below), or you can click the \"Actions\" tab in your repository. From there you will see the actions that have run, and you can click on the action's \"Log\" link to view details.\n\n![View an action's log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/62388049-4e64e600-b52a-11e9-8bf5-db0c5452360f.png)\n\n## Step 6: Trigger the workflow\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: See your action trigger the workflow\n\nYou've done the work, now sit back and see your action trigger the workflow!\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">I will respond when I detect your action has run and reported a status.</h3>\n\n> _Actions can take a minute or two to run. Sometimes, I also respond too fast for the page to update! If you don't see a response from your action, wait a few seconds and refresh the page._\n",

Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1. Create a markdown list in the file. It can be ordered or unordered.\n1. Commit your changes.\n\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\n",

                "body": "## Step 8: Add a list\n\nIn this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.\n\n:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Emoji</summary>\n\n  ### Emoji\n\n  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams \u2705. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:\n\n  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.\n\n  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.\n\n  | What you see | What you type |\n  | ---------- | ------------ |\n  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |\n  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |\n  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |\n  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |\n  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |\n\n  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.\n\n  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Ordered Lists\n\n  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.\n\n  ```\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n  ```\n\n  1. Item 1\n  2. Item 2\n  3. Item 3\n     1. Item 3a\n     2. Item 3b\n\n <hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>\n\n  ### Unordered Lists\n\n  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.\n\n  ```\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n  ```\n\n  * Item 1\n  * Item 2\n    * Item 2a\n    * Item 2b\n\n  <hr>\n</details>\n\n### Adding a list\n\nHelp people get to know you by adding a list containing a few of your favorite things. Don't know what to add? Why not add a list of your favorite books or places to eat.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a list\n\n\n1. Edit the `_includes/04-lists.md` in this pull request.\n1.
