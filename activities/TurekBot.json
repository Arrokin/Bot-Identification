Unfortunately, this has the\nside effect of throwing exceptions when attempting to write to the `NUL:` device.\n\nThis validity check is gated behind a property `jdk.io.File.enableADS`, which is set to `false` for\n`11.0.15+10`, `17.0.3+7` releases of the JDK (it will be set to `true` for the next set of JDK releases)\nThis is causing our gradle jobs to fail, as the property is not set when the gradle daemon starts, as the\nproperty is set after the test to determine the value is performed. This will fail for any Windows builds that\nuse the affected JDKs, and attempt to write to the `NUL:` device\n\nRelates: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/14075\n\n### Contributor Checklist\n- [x] [Review Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [x] Make sure that all commits are [signed off](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) to indicate that you agree to the terms of [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).\n- [x] Make sure all contributed code can be distributed under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/LICENSE), e.g. the code was written by yourself or the original code is licensed under [a license compatible to Apache License 2.0](https://apache.org/legal/resolved.html).\n- [x] Check [\"Allow edit from maintainers\" option](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/) in pull request so that additional changes can be pushed by Gradle team\n- [ ] Provide integration tests (under `<subproject>/src/integTest`) to verify changes from a user perspective\n- [ ] Provide unit tests (under `<subproject>/src/test`) to verify logic\n- [ ] Update User Guide, DSL Reference, and Javadoc for public-facing changes\n- [ ] Ensure that tests pass sanity check: `./gradlew sanityCheck`\n- [ ] Ensure that tests pass locally: `./gradlew <changed-subproject>:quickTest`\n\n### Gradle Core Team Checklist\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\n- [ ] Verify documentation\n- [ ] Recognize contributor in release notes\n\nCo-authored-by: Sergey Igushkin <sigushkin@gradle.com>",

Unfortunately, this has the\nside effect of throwing exceptions when attempting to write to the `NUL:` device.\n\nThis validity check is gated behind a property `jdk.io.File.enableADS`, which is set to `false` for\n`11.0.15+10`, `17.0.3+7` releases of the JDK (it will be set to `true` for the next set of JDK releases)\nThis is causing our gradle jobs to fail, as the property is not set when the gradle daemon starts, as the\nproperty is set after the test to determine the value is performed.
