A full rationale can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918#issue-552884252. But in short: integer logarithms [are fairly common](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLog10), but require care to implement correctly, and effort to implement efficiently.\r\n\r\nBecause we expose `log` methods for floats it can be tempting for users to use that instead, which can lead to rounding errors. In the following example we're trying to calculate `base10` for an integer. We might try and calculate the `base2` for the values, and attempt [a base swap](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#log-rules) to arrive at `base10`. However because we're performing intermediate rounding we arrive at the wrong result:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// log10(900) = ~2.95 = 2\r\ndbg!(900f32.log10() as u64);\r\n    \r\n// log base change rule: logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)\r\n// log2(900) / log2(10) = 9/3 = 3, which is incorrect!\r\ndbg!((900f32.log2() as u64) / (10f32.log2() as u64));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.ilog(5), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.ilog2(), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.ilog10(), 1);\r\n\r\n// checked integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.checked_ilog(5), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.checked_ilog2(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.checked_ilog10(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(0_u64.checked_ilog(5), None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918\r\n- [x] Stabilization report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-1210602692\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Can we further optimize the `ilog10` implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-609976593\r\n- [x] Can we make these methods `const fn`?\r\n- [x] Can we implement these types for `NonZero{Int}`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611336828\r\n    - [x] Can we omit returning `Option` for `ilog2/ilog10` on `NonZero{Int}`?\r\n- [x] Should the methods be called `Integer::{ilog,ilog2,ilog10}` instead? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611998098 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-616580640\r\n\r\n## Implementation History\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835 - initial PR, closed due to inactivity\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918 - attempt 2 to implement `log` methods, merged\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92956 - `log` methods for `NonZero` types\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100332 - rename `log` methods to `ilog`\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102578 - panic on invalid args\r\n",

(It is not *entirely* clear that this was intended when the `dereferenceable` attribute was added, given that the attribute was also added to `Box` which can definitely be deallocated by functions they are passed to. But when that got fixed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66600, nobody suggested to also remove the attribute from references.)\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether we actually *want* these rules, they *do* reflect our current requirements and code not following them risks miscompilations. As such I think we should document them here and consider them the baseline for changes to the aliasing model. It's not great to have a baseline that was never carefully reviewed or designed, but for better or worse that's where we are at.\r\n\r\nAlso incorporates https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98017.\r\n\r\n[Rendered](https://github.com/RalfJung/reference/blob/aliasing/src/behavior-considered-undefined.md)\r\n\r\nCc @rust-lang/lang",

This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` and `ObligationCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers have to be rewritten where possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system as at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers, have to be rewriten as much as possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system as at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers, have to be rewriten as much as possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system as at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers, have to be rewriten as much as possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

Please consult with the team before\r\nopening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted\r\nwill be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThanks for submitting a pull request \ud83c\udf89! Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes #11251.\r\n\r\nThis adds a line like `Packaged 42 files, 727.0KiB (143.8KiB compressed)` to the output of `cargo package` and `cargo publish`. See the associated issue for more details.\r\n\r\n### Test info\r\n\r\nI've updated associated tests to account for the new line in the output, including the file count where relevant. I've also added a few additional tests specifically to address the uncompressed and compressed file sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test this manually, simply run `cargo package` or `cargo publish` within a project of your choice. The new `Packaged` line will appear at the end of the stderr output, or directly before the `Uploaded` line, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Review info\r\n\r\nThis PR touches many test files to account for the additional line of stderr output. For convenience, I've split the PR into 4 commits.\r\n1. contains the actual implementation\r\n2. updates existing tests unrelated to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`\r\n3. updates existing tests related to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`, including file counts where relevant\r\n4. adds new tests specifically for the file sizes, which are generally not covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe feature was discussed [on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Report.20crate.20size.20when.20packaging) prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nPotential future extensions to explore include:\r\n- Report size per file when using `--verbose`\r\n- Compare to the size of the previously uploaded version to warn if the increase is sufficiently large\r\n- Consider designs that can draw more attention to the most important information\r\n- Warn if large binary files are included ([#9058](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9058))",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "WF check currently treats `WF(for<'a> fn(MyType<'a>))` differently from `for<'a> WF(MyType<'a>)`. The first one uses a bound variable when computing the WF requirements for `MyType`, while the second one first instantiates the bound variable with a placeholder. This means that currently, we emit WF requirements in the second case while discarding them for the first.\r\n\r\nHowever, checking WF for the second one is also broken by binders not having any implications. See `src/test/ui/wf/higher-ranked/on-impl.rs` which currently fails. ([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=46d4f2f24f152fc0361a9afc42efff1e)) This happens because `for<'a> &'a T` should mean `for<'a> where { T: 'a } &'a T` instead of `&'a T`. When adding implied bounds to `predicates_of`, this kind of issue happens pretty much all the time we have any higher ranked trait bound. We should therefore also skip nested obligations in wf if they have placeholders.\r\n\r\nAs long as we do not consider WF bounds for implied-bounds, this should not cause any additional unsoundness. It may allow for more instances of [an undesirable pattern](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=8991a3bfef466a8dd7b3ae9f03858074) but doing so is difficult. For impls, most of the time the **placeholders when using the impl** were **free regions when checking the impl**, at which point we did consider to nested obligations. It is possible using higher ranked bounds, see `src/test/ui/wf/higher-ranked/ignored-trait-bound.rs` where `HasWfPlaceholder` currently results in an error but is allowed with this PR.\r\n\r\nI don't expect this change to meaningfully impact the prevalence of this pattern. In our test suite there is a single existing test for which we now skip a nested obligation while there are far more tests where we discard candidates due to escaping bound vars. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d49e7e7fa13479c11a3733824c78e280e391288b/src/test/ui/higher-rank-trait-bounds/issue-95230.rs#L3-L7\r\n\r\nThis unblocks future work on implied bounds and feels like an acceptable band-aid until we can correctly deal with implications.\r\n\r\nr? types",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

A full rationale can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918#issue-552884252. But in short: integer logarithms [are fairly common](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLog10), but require care to implement correctly, and effort to implement efficiently.\r\n\r\nBecause we expose `log` methods for floats it can be tempting for users to use that instead, which can lead to rounding errors. In the following example we're trying to calculate `base10` for an integer. We might try and calculate the `base2` for the values, and attempt [a base swap](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#log-rules) to arrive at `base10`. However because we're performing intermediate rounding we arrive at the wrong result:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// log10(900) = ~2.95 = 2\r\ndbg!(900f32.log10() as u64);\r\n    \r\n// log base change rule: logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)\r\n// log2(900) / log2(10) = 9/3 = 3, which is incorrect!\r\ndbg!((900f32.log2() as u64) / (10f32.log2() as u64));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.ilog(5), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.ilog2(), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.ilog10(), 1);\r\n\r\n// checked integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.checked_ilog(5), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.checked_ilog2(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.checked_ilog10(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(0_u64.checked_ilog(5), None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918\r\n- [x] Stabilization report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-1210602692\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Can we further optimize the `ilog10` implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-609976593\r\n- [x] Can we make these methods `const fn`?\r\n- [x] Can we implement these types for `NonZero{Int}`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611336828\r\n    - [x] Can we omit returning `Option` for `ilog2/ilog10` on `NonZero{Int}`?\r\n- [x] Should the methods be called `Integer::{ilog,ilog2,ilog10}` instead? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611998098 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-616580640\r\n\r\n## Implementation History\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835 - initial PR, closed due to inactivity\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918 - attempt 2 to implement `log` methods, merged\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92956 - `log` methods for `NonZero` types\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100332 - rename `log` methods to `ilog`\r\n",

Please consult with the team before\r\nopening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted\r\nwill be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThanks for submitting a pull request \ud83c\udf89! Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes #11251.\r\n\r\nThis adds a line like `Packaged 42 files, 727.0KiB (143.8KiB compressed)` to the output of `cargo package` and `cargo publish`. See the associated issue for more details.\r\n\r\n### Test info\r\n\r\nI've updated associated tests to account for the new line in the output, including the file count where relevant. I've also added a few additional tests specifically to address the uncompressed and compressed file sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test this manually, simply run `cargo package` or `cargo publish` within a project of your choice. The new `Packaged` line will appear at the end of the stderr output, or directly before the `Uploaded` line, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Review info\r\n\r\nThis PR touches many test files to account for the additional line of stderr output. For convenience, I've split the PR into 4 commits.\r\n1. contains the actual implementation\r\n2. updates existing tests unrelated to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`\r\n3. updates existing tests related to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`, including file counts where relevant\r\n4. adds new tests specifically for the file sizes, which are generally not covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe feature was discussed [on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Report.20crate.20size.20when.20packaging) prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nPotential future extensions to explore include:\r\n- Report size per file when using `--verbose`\r\n- Compare to the size of the previously uploaded version to warn if the increase is sufficiently large\r\n- Consider designs that can draw more attention to the most important information\r\n- Warn if large binary files are included ([#9058](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9058))",

                "body": "Originally, crates.io would block on publish requests until the publish\r\nwas complete, giving `cargo publish` this behavior by extension.  When\r\ncrates.io switched to asynchronous publishing, this intermittently broke\r\npeople's workflows when publishing multiple crates.  I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

Which is a hard constraint and won't success without deref coercion.\r\n\r\nThis PR taks the same path as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/20083 (remove the hard constraint on `check_expr_with_expectation` when meets a unsized type). When the compiler see a `AddrOf(Foo(...))`(e.g. `&{ Box::new(1i32) }`), removes the hard constraint that this `Foo` have some type.\r\n\r\nFixes #26978\r\nFixes #57749 \r\nFixes #83783 ",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

Having both of their functionality together requires writing your own boilerplate for something that makes sense to have in the standard library. This PR adds the functionality of `io::Sink` to `io::Empty`, making `io::Empty` be able to perform the tasks of both of the previous structs. (This idea was first mentioned in #24235)\r\n\r\nNote: I also updated some doc comments in `io::utils` in this pull request to fix inconsistencies between `io::Sink` and `io::Empty`.\r\n\r\nAPI Change Proposal: https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/49",

In my opinion, the error type shares the name of the method (adjusted to accommodate both types of floats), which is consistent with other error types in `core`, `alloc` and `std` like `TryReserveError` and `TryFromIntError`.\r\n\r\n## Experience Report\r\n\r\nCode such as this is ready to be converted to a checked API to ensure it is panic free:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Time {\r\n    pub fn checked_add_f64(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<Self, TimeError> {\r\n        // Fail safely during `f64` conversion to duration\r\n        if seconds.is_nan() || seconds.is_infinite() {\r\n            return Err(TzOutOfRangeError::new().into());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if seconds.is_sign_positive() {\r\n            self.checked_add(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds))\r\n        } else {\r\n            self.checked_sub(Duration::from_secs_f64(-seconds))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/2194.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs\r\n\r\ncc @mbartlett21 ",

                "body": "The documentation for `UnsafeCell<T>` currently does not make any promises about its memory layout. This PR adds this documentation, namely that the memory layout of `UnsafeCell<T>` is the same as the memory layout of its inner `T`.\r\n\r\n# Use case\r\nWithout this layout promise, the following cast would not be legally possible:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn example<T>(ptr: *mut T) -> *const UnsafeCell<T> {\r\n  ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA use case where this can come up involves FFI. If Rust receives a pointer over a FFI boundary which provides shared read-write access (with some form of custom synchronization), and this pointer is managed by some Rust struct with lifetime `'a`, then it would greatly simplify its (internal) API and safety contract if a `&'a UnsafeCell<T>` can be created from a raw FFI pointer `*mut T`. A lot of safety checks can be done when receiving the pointer for the first time through FFI (non-nullness, alignment, initialize uninit bytes, etc.) and these properties can then be encoded into the `&UnsafeCell<T>` type. Without this documentation guarantee, this is not legal today outside of the standard library.\r\n\r\n# Caveats\r\nCasting in the opposite direction is still not valid, even with this documentation change:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn example2<T>(ptr: &UnsafeCell<T>) -> &mut T {\r\n  let t = ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T> as *mut T;\r\n  unsafe { &mut *t }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the only legal way to obtain a mutable pointer to the contents of the shared reference is through [`UnsafeCell::get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.get) and [`UnsafeCell::raw_get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.raw_get). Although there might be a desire to also make this legal at some point in the future, that part is outside the scope of this PR. Also see this relevant [Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/136281-t-lang.2Fwg-unsafe-code-guidelines/topic/transmuting.20.26.20-.3E.20.26mut).\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\nInstead of adding a new documentation promise, it's also possible to add a new method to `UnsafeCell<T>` with signature `pub fn from_ptr_bikeshed(ptr: *mut T) -> *const UnsafeCell<T>` which indirectly only allows one-way casting to `*const UnsafeCell<T>`.",

                "body": "Originally, crates.io would block on publish requests until the publish\r\nwas complete, giving `cargo publish` this behavior by extension.  When\r\ncrates.io switched to asynchronous publishing, this intermittently broke\r\npeople's workflows when publishing multiple crates.  I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

                "body": "Originally, crates.io would block on publish requests until the publish\r\nwas complete, giving `cargo publish` this behavior by extension.  When\r\ncrates.io switched to asynchronous publishing, this intermittently broke\r\npeople's workflows when publishing multiple crates.  I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

                "body": "## What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nThis PR merges `cargo remove` from [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) into cargo.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n- General approval from community, see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5586 and https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10520.\r\n- Satisfying symmetry between add and remove.\r\n- Help users clean up their manifests (for example, when users forget to remove optional dependencies from feature lists).\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10472, cargo-add was added to cargo. As part of that discussion, it was also proposed that `cargo rm` (now `cargo remove`) eventually be added as well.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- Additional code always opens the door for more bugs and features\r\n  - The scope of this command is fairly small though\r\n  - Known bugs and most known features were resolved before this merge proposal\r\n\r\n### Behavior\r\n\r\n`cargo remove` operates on one or more dependencies from a manifest, removing them from a specified dependencies section (using the same flags as `cargo-add`) and from `[features]` activations if the dependency is optional. Feature lists themselves are not automatically removed when made empty.  Like with cargo-add, the lock file is automatically updated.\r\n\r\nNote: like `cargo add`, `cargo remove` refers to dependency names, rather than crate names, which can be different with the presence of the `name` field.\r\n\r\nNote: `cargo rm` has been renamed to `cargo remove`, based on prior art and user feedback (see [discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10520)). Although this renaming is arguably an improvement, adding an `rm` alias could make the switch easier for existing users of cargo-edit (at the cost of a naming conflict which would merit insta-stabilization).\r\n\r\n#### Help output\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  $ cargo run -- remove --help\r\n  cargo-remove\r\n  Remove dependencies from a Cargo.toml manifest file\r\n\r\n  USAGE:\r\n      cargo remove [OPTIONS] <DEP_ID>...\r\n\r\n  ARGS:\r\n      <DEP_ID>...

If you are interested in seeing how this feature evolved to better match cargo's internals, you might find the commit history there to be helpful. As this PR is reviewed, changes will be made both here and on that branch, with the commit history being fully maintained on the latter.\r\n\r\n`cargo remove` is structured like most other subcommands:\r\n\r\n- `src/bin/cargo/commands/remove.rs` contains the cli handling and top-level execution.\r\n- `src/cargo/ops/cargo_remove.rs` contains the implementation of the feature itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this feature, the `remove_from_table` util was added to `util::toml_mut::manifest::LocalManifest`.\r\n\r\nTests are split out into a separate commit to make it easier to review the production code and tests.  Tests have been implemented with `snapbox`, structured similarly to the tests of `cargo add`.\r\n\r\n### Prior art\r\n\r\n- Python: [`poetry remove`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#remove)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n- JavaScript: [`yarn remove`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/remove)\r\n  - Supports wildcards\r\n- JavaScript: [`pnpm remove`](https://pnpm.io/cli/remove)\r\n- Go: [`go get`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-get)\r\n  - `go get foo@none` to remove\r\n- Julia: [`pkg rm`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/)\r\n  - Supports `--all` to remove all dependencies\r\n- Ruby: [`bundle remove`](https://bundler.io/v2.2/man/bundle-remove.1.html)\r\n- Dart: [`dart pub remove`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-remove)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n- Lua: [`luarocks remove`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/remove)\r\n  - Supports force remove\r\n- .NET: [`Uninstall-Package`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n  - Supports removal of dependencies\r\n  - Supports force remove (disregards dependencies)\r\n- Haxe: [`haxelib remove`](https://lib.haxe.org/documentation/using-haxelib/#remove)\r\n- Racket: [`raco pkg remove`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-remove%29)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n  - Supports force remove (disregards dependencies)\r\n  - Supports demotion to weak dependency (sort of a corollary of force remove)\r\n\r\n### Insta-stabilization\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of `cargo add`'s stabilization story ([Zulip stream](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Stablizing.20cargo-add)), it was brought up that the feature might benefit from being insta-stabilized to avoid making the cargo-edit version of the binary hard to access. Since `cargo rm` (from cargo-edit) was renamed to `cargo remove` here, [such a conflict no longer exists](https://crates.io/search?q=cargo%20remove), so this is less of a concern.\r\n\r\nSince this feature is already has a had a long run of user testing in cargo-edit and doesn't have unsettled UI questions like cargo-add did, it might still be a candidate for insta-stabilization.\r\n\r\n### Deferred work\r\n\r\nNecessary future work:\r\n\r\n- Add documentation.\r\n- Add shell completions.\r\n- Perform GC on workspace dependencies when they are no longer used (see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8415).\r\n  - This is inspired by a feature from the RFC that was dropped (unused dependencies triggering a warning)\r\n  - This was deferred out to avoid challenges with testing nightly features\r\n\r\nIt was found in the review of `cargo add` that it was best to defer these first two items to focus the discussion and as there was still behavior churn during the review of cargo-add.\r\n\r\n### Future Possibilities\r\n\r\nThe following are features which we might want to add to `cargo remove` in the future:\r\n\r\n- Add a `cargo rm` alias to ease transition for current cargo-edit users\r\n- Automatically convert between dash and underscores in deps: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/690\r\n- Remove unused dependencies: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/415\r\n- Clean up caches: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/647\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFixes #10520.\r\n",

Having both of their functionality together requires writing your own boilerplate for something that makes sense to have in the standard library. This PR adds the functionality of `io::Sink` to `io::Empty`, making `io::Empty` be able to perform the tasks of both of the previous structs. (This idea was first mentioned in #24235)\r\n\r\nNote: I also updated some doc comments in `io::utils` in this pull request to fix inconsistencies between `io::Sink` and `io::Empty`.\r\n\r\nAPI Change Proposal: https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/49",

In my opinion, the error type shares the name of the method (adjusted to accommodate both types of floats), which is consistent with other error types in `core`, `alloc` and `std` like `TryReserveError` and `TryFromIntError`.\r\n\r\n## Experience Report\r\n\r\nCode such as this is ready to be converted to a checked API to ensure it is panic free:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Time {\r\n    pub fn checked_add_f64(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<Self, TimeError> {\r\n        // Fail safely during `f64` conversion to duration\r\n        if seconds.is_nan() || seconds.is_infinite() {\r\n            return Err(TzOutOfRangeError::new().into());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if seconds.is_sign_positive() {\r\n            self.checked_add(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds))\r\n        } else {\r\n            self.checked_sub(Duration::from_secs_f64(-seconds))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/2194.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs\r\n\r\ncc @mbartlett21 ",

A full rationale can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918#issue-552884252. But in short: integer logarithms [are fairly common](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLog10), but require care to implement correctly, and effort to implement efficiently.\r\n\r\nBecause we expose `log` methods for floats it can be tempting for users to use that instead, which can lead to rounding errors. In the following example we're trying to calculate `base10` for an integer. We might try and calculate the `base2` for the values, and attempt [a base swap](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#log-rules) to arrive at `base10`. However because we're performing intermediate rounding we arrive at the wrong result:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// log10(900) = ~2.95 = 2\r\ndbg!(900f32.log10() as u64);\r\n    \r\n// log base change rule: logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)\r\n// log2(900) / log2(10) = 9/3 = 3, which is incorrect!\r\ndbg!((900f32.log2() as u64) / (10f32.log2() as u64));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.ilog(5), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.ilog2(), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.ilog10(), 1);\r\n\r\n// checked integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.checked_ilog(5), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.checked_ilog2(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.checked_ilog10(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(0_u64.checked_ilog(5), None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918\r\n- [x] Stabilization report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-1210602692\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Can we further optimize the `ilog10` implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-609976593\r\n- [x] Can we make these methods `const fn`?\r\n- [x] Can we implement these types for `NonZero{Int}`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611336828\r\n    - [x] Can we omit returning `Option` for `ilog2/ilog10` on `NonZero{Int}`?\r\n- [x] Should the methods be called `Integer::{ilog,ilog2,ilog10}` instead? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611998098 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-616580640\r\n\r\n## Implementation History\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835 - initial PR, closed due to inactivity\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918 - attempt 2 to implement `log` methods, merged\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92956 - `log` methods for `NonZero` types\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100332 - rename `log` methods to `ilog`\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102578 - panic on invalid args\r\n",

(It is not *entirely* clear that this was intended when the `dereferenceable` attribute was added, given that the attribute was also added to `Box` which can definitely be deallocated by functions they are passed to. But when that got fixed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66600, nobody suggested to also remove the attribute from references.)\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether we actually *want* these rules, they *do* reflect our current requirements and code not following them risks miscompilations. As such I think we should document them here and consider them the baseline for changes to the aliasing model. It's not great to have a baseline that was never carefully reviewed or designed, but for better or worse that's where we are at.\r\n\r\nAlso incorporates https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98017.\r\n\r\n[Rendered](https://github.com/RalfJung/reference/blob/aliasing/src/behavior-considered-undefined.md)\r\n\r\nCc @rust-lang/lang",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` and `ObligationCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers have to be rewritten where possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system as at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers, have to be rewriten as much as possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

Please consult with the team before\r\nopening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted\r\nwill be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThanks for submitting a pull request \ud83c\udf89! Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes #11251.\r\n\r\nThis adds a line like `Packaged 42 files, 727.0KiB (143.8KiB compressed)` to the output of `cargo package` and `cargo publish`. See the associated issue for more details.\r\n\r\n### Test info\r\n\r\nI've updated associated tests to account for the new line in the output, including the file count where relevant. I've also added a few additional tests specifically to address the uncompressed and compressed file sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test this manually, simply run `cargo package` or `cargo publish` within a project of your choice. The new `Packaged` line will appear at the end of the stderr output, or directly before the `Uploaded` line, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Review info\r\n\r\nThis PR touches many test files to account for the additional line of stderr output. For convenience, I've split the PR into 4 commits.\r\n1. contains the actual implementation\r\n2. updates existing tests unrelated to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`\r\n3. updates existing tests related to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`, including file counts where relevant\r\n4. adds new tests specifically for the file sizes, which are generally not covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe feature was discussed [on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Report.20crate.20size.20when.20packaging) prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nPotential future extensions to explore include:\r\n- Report size per file when using `--verbose`\r\n- Compare to the size of the previously uploaded version to warn if the increase is sufficiently large\r\n- Consider designs that can draw more attention to the most important information\r\n- Warn if large binary files are included ([#9058](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9058))",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "WF check currently treats `WF(for<'a> fn(MyType<'a>))` differently from `for<'a> WF(MyType<'a>)`. The first one uses a bound variable when computing the WF requirements for `MyType`, while the second one first instantiates the bound variable with a placeholder. This means that currently, we emit WF requirements in the second case while discarding them for the first.\r\n\r\nHowever, checking WF for the second one is also broken by binders not having any implications. See `src/test/ui/wf/higher-ranked/on-impl.rs` which currently fails. ([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=46d4f2f24f152fc0361a9afc42efff1e)) This happens because `for<'a> &'a T` should mean `for<'a> where { T: 'a } &'a T` instead of `&'a T`. When adding implied bounds to `predicates_of`, this kind of issue happens pretty much all the time we have any higher ranked trait bound. We should therefore also skip nested obligations in wf if they have placeholders.\r\n\r\nAs long as we do not consider WF bounds for implied-bounds, this should not cause any additional unsoundness. It may allow for more instances of [an undesirable pattern](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=8991a3bfef466a8dd7b3ae9f03858074) but doing so is difficult. For impls, most of the time the **placeholders when using the impl** were **free regions when checking the impl**, at which point we did consider to nested obligations. It is possible using higher ranked bounds, see `src/test/ui/wf/higher-ranked/ignored-trait-bound.rs` where `HasWfPlaceholder` currently results in an error but is allowed with this PR.\r\n\r\nI don't expect this change to meaningfully impact the prevalence of this pattern. In our test suite there is a single existing test for which we now skip a nested obligation while there are far more tests where we discard candidates due to escaping bound vars. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d49e7e7fa13479c11a3733824c78e280e391288b/src/test/ui/higher-rank-trait-bounds/issue-95230.rs#L3-L7\r\n\r\nThis unblocks future work on implied bounds and feels like an acceptable band-aid until we can correctly deal with implications.\r\n\r\nr? types",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

A full rationale can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918#issue-552884252. But in short: integer logarithms [are fairly common](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLog10), but require care to implement correctly, and effort to implement efficiently.\r\n\r\nBecause we expose `log` methods for floats it can be tempting for users to use that instead, which can lead to rounding errors. In the following example we're trying to calculate `base10` for an integer. We might try and calculate the `base2` for the values, and attempt [a base swap](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#log-rules) to arrive at `base10`. However because we're performing intermediate rounding we arrive at the wrong result:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// log10(900) = ~2.95 = 2\r\ndbg!(900f32.log10() as u64);\r\n    \r\n// log base change rule: logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)\r\n// log2(900) / log2(10) = 9/3 = 3, which is incorrect!\r\ndbg!((900f32.log2() as u64) / (10f32.log2() as u64));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.ilog(5), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.ilog2(), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.ilog10(), 1);\r\n\r\n// checked integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.checked_ilog(5), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.checked_ilog2(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.checked_ilog10(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(0_u64.checked_ilog(5), None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918\r\n- [x] Stabilization report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-1210602692\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Can we further optimize the `ilog10` implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-609976593\r\n- [x] Can we make these methods `const fn`?\r\n- [x] Can we implement these types for `NonZero{Int}`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611336828\r\n    - [x] Can we omit returning `Option` for `ilog2/ilog10` on `NonZero{Int}`?\r\n- [x] Should the methods be called `Integer::{ilog,ilog2,ilog10}` instead? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611998098 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-616580640\r\n\r\n## Implementation History\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835 - initial PR, closed due to inactivity\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918 - attempt 2 to implement `log` methods, merged\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92956 - `log` methods for `NonZero` types\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100332 - rename `log` methods to `ilog`\r\n",

Please consult with the team before\r\nopening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted\r\nwill be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThanks for submitting a pull request \ud83c\udf89! Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes #11251.\r\n\r\nThis adds a line like `Packaged 42 files, 727.0KiB (143.8KiB compressed)` to the output of `cargo package` and `cargo publish`. See the associated issue for more details.\r\n\r\n### Test info\r\n\r\nI've updated associated tests to account for the new line in the output, including the file count where relevant. I've also added a few additional tests specifically to address the uncompressed and compressed file sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test this manually, simply run `cargo package` or `cargo publish` within a project of your choice. The new `Packaged` line will appear at the end of the stderr output, or directly before the `Uploaded` line, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Review info\r\n\r\nThis PR touches many test files to account for the additional line of stderr output. For convenience, I've split the PR into 4 commits.\r\n1. contains the actual implementation\r\n2. updates existing tests unrelated to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`\r\n3. updates existing tests related to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`, including file counts where relevant\r\n4. adds new tests specifically for the file sizes, which are generally not covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe feature was discussed [on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Report.20crate.20size.20when.20packaging) prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nPotential future extensions to explore include:\r\n- Report size per file when using `--verbose`\r\n- Compare to the size of the previously uploaded version to warn if the increase is sufficiently large\r\n- Consider designs that can draw more attention to the most important information\r\n- Warn if large binary files are included ([#9058](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9058))",

                "body": "Originally, crates.io would block on publish requests until the publish\r\nwas complete, giving `cargo publish` this behavior by extension.  When\r\ncrates.io switched to asynchronous publishing, this intermittently broke\r\npeople's workflows when publishing multiple crates.  I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

When the compiler see a `AddrOf(Foo(...))`(e.g. `&{ Box::new(1i32) }`), removes the hard constraint that this `Foo` have some type.\r\n\r\nFixes #26978\r\nFixes #57749 \r\nFixes #83783 ",

When the compiler see a `AddrOf(Foo(...))`(e.g. `&{ Box::new(1i32) }`), removes the hard constraint that this `Foo` have some type.\r\n\r\nFixes #26978\r\nFixes #57749 \r\nFixes #83783 ",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

Having both of their functionality together requires writing your own boilerplate for something that makes sense to have in the standard library. This PR adds the functionality of `io::Sink` to `io::Empty`, making `io::Empty` be able to perform the tasks of both of the previous structs.

In my opinion, the error type shares the name of the method (adjusted to accommodate both types of floats), which is consistent with other error types in `core`, `alloc` and `std` like `TryReserveError` and `TryFromIntError`.\r\n\r\n## Experience Report\r\n\r\nCode such as this is ready to be converted to a checked API to ensure it is panic free:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Time {\r\n    pub fn checked_add_f64(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<Self, TimeError> {\r\n        // Fail safely during `f64` conversion to duration\r\n        if seconds.is_nan() || seconds.is_infinite() {\r\n            return Err(TzOutOfRangeError::new().into());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if seconds.is_sign_positive() {\r\n            self.checked_add(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds))\r\n        } else {\r\n            self.checked_sub(Duration::from_secs_f64(-seconds))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/2194.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs\r\n\r\ncc @mbartlett21 ",

                "body": "The documentation for `UnsafeCell<T>` currently does not make any promises about its memory layout. This PR adds this documentation, namely that the memory layout of `UnsafeCell<T>` is the same as the memory layout of its inner `T`.\r\n\r\n# Use case\r\nWithout this layout promise, the following cast would not be legally possible:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn example<T>(ptr: *mut T) -> *const UnsafeCell<T> {\r\n  ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA use case where this can come up involves FFI. If Rust receives a pointer over a FFI boundary which provides shared read-write access (with some form of custom synchronization), and this pointer is managed by some Rust struct with lifetime `'a`, then it would greatly simplify its (internal) API and safety contract if a `&'a UnsafeCell<T>` can be created from a raw FFI pointer `*mut T`. A lot of safety checks can be done when receiving the pointer for the first time through FFI (non-nullness, alignment, initialize uninit bytes, etc.) and these properties can then be encoded into the `&UnsafeCell<T>` type. Without this documentation guarantee, this is not legal today outside of the standard library.\r\n\r\n# Caveats\r\nCasting in the opposite direction is still not valid, even with this documentation change:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn example2<T>(ptr: &UnsafeCell<T>) -> &mut T {\r\n  let t = ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T> as *mut T;\r\n  unsafe { &mut *t }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the only legal way to obtain a mutable pointer to the contents of the shared reference is through [`UnsafeCell::get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.get) and [`UnsafeCell::raw_get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.raw_get). Although there might be a desire to also make this legal at some point in the future, that part is outside the scope of this PR. Also see this relevant [Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/136281-t-lang.2Fwg-unsafe-code-guidelines/topic/transmuting.20.26.20-.3E.20.26mut).\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\nInstead of adding a new documentation promise, it's also possible to add a new method to `UnsafeCell<T>` with signature `pub fn from_ptr_bikeshed(ptr: *mut T) -> *const UnsafeCell<T>` which indirectly only allows one-way casting to `*const UnsafeCell<T>`.",

                "body": "Originally, crates.io would block on publish requests until the publish\r\nwas complete, giving `cargo publish` this behavior by extension.  When\r\ncrates.io switched to asynchronous publishing, this intermittently broke\r\npeople's workflows when publishing multiple crates.  I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

                "body": "Originally, crates.io would block on publish requests until the publish\r\nwas complete, giving `cargo publish` this behavior by extension.  When\r\ncrates.io switched to asynchronous publishing, this intermittently broke\r\npeople's workflows when publishing multiple crates.  I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

As part of that discussion, it was also proposed that `cargo rm` (now `cargo remove`) eventually be added as well.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- Additional code always opens the door for more bugs and features\r\n  - The scope of this command is fairly small though\r\n  - Known bugs and most known features were resolved before this merge proposal\r\n\r\n### Behavior\r\n\r\n`cargo remove` operates on one or more dependencies from a manifest, removing them from a specified dependencies section (using the same flags as `cargo-add`) and from `[features]` activations if the dependency is optional. Feature lists themselves are not automatically removed when made empty.  Like with cargo-add, the lock file is automatically updated.\r\n\r\nNote: like `cargo add`, `cargo remove` refers to dependency names, rather than crate names, which can be different with the presence of the `name` field.\r\n\r\nNote: `cargo rm` has been renamed to `cargo remove`, based on prior art and user feedback (see [discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10520)). Although this renaming is arguably an improvement, adding an `rm` alias could make the switch easier for existing users of cargo-edit (at the cost of a naming conflict which would merit insta-stabilization).\r\n\r\n#### Help output\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  $ cargo run -- remove --help\r\n  cargo-remove\r\n  Remove dependencies from a Cargo.toml manifest file\r\n\r\n  USAGE:\r\n      cargo remove [OPTIONS] <DEP_ID>...\r\n\r\n  ARGS:\r\n      <DEP_ID>...

If you are interested in seeing how this feature evolved to better match cargo's internals, you might find the commit history there to be helpful. As this PR is reviewed, changes will be made both here and on that branch, with the commit history being fully maintained on the latter.\r\n\r\n`cargo remove` is structured like most other subcommands:\r\n\r\n- `src/bin/cargo/commands/remove.rs` contains the cli handling and top-level execution.\r\n- `src/cargo/ops/cargo_remove.rs` contains the implementation of the feature itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this feature, the `remove_from_table` util was added to `util::toml_mut::manifest::LocalManifest`.\r\n\r\nTests are split out into a separate commit to make it easier to review the production code and tests.  Tests have been implemented with `snapbox`, structured similarly to the tests of `cargo add`.\r\n\r\n### Prior art\r\n\r\n- Python: [`poetry remove`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#remove)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n- JavaScript: [`yarn remove`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/remove)\r\n  - Supports wildcards\r\n- JavaScript: [`pnpm remove`](https://pnpm.io/cli/remove)\r\n- Go: [`go get`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-get)\r\n  - `go get foo@none` to remove\r\n- Julia: [`pkg rm`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/)\r\n  - Supports `--all` to remove all dependencies\r\n- Ruby: [`bundle remove`](https://bundler.io/v2.2/man/bundle-remove.1.html)\r\n- Dart: [`dart pub remove`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-remove)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n- Lua: [`luarocks remove`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/remove)\r\n  - Supports force remove\r\n- .NET: [`Uninstall-Package`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n  - Supports removal of dependencies\r\n  - Supports force remove (disregards dependencies)\r\n- Haxe: [`haxelib remove`](https://lib.haxe.org/documentation/using-haxelib/#remove)\r\n- Racket: [`raco pkg remove`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-remove%29)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n  - Supports force remove (disregards dependencies)\r\n  - Supports demotion to weak dependency (sort of a corollary of force remove)\r\n\r\n### Insta-stabilization\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of `cargo add`'s stabilization story ([Zulip stream](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Stablizing.20cargo-add)), it was brought up that the feature might benefit from being insta-stabilized to avoid making the cargo-edit version of the binary hard to access. Since `cargo rm` (from cargo-edit) was renamed to `cargo remove` here, [such a conflict no longer exists](https://crates.io/search?q=cargo%20remove), so this is less of a concern.\r\n\r\nSince this feature is already has a had a long run of user testing in cargo-edit and doesn't have unsettled UI questions like cargo-add did, it might still be a candidate for insta-stabilization.\r\n\r\n### Deferred work\r\n\r\nNecessary future work:\r\n\r\n- Add documentation.\r\n- Add shell completions.\r\n- Perform GC on workspace dependencies when they are no longer used (see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8415).\r\n  - This is inspired by a feature from the RFC that was dropped (unused dependencies triggering a warning)\r\n  - This was deferred out to avoid challenges with testing nightly features\r\n\r\nIt was found in the review of `cargo add` that it was best to defer these first two items to focus the discussion and as there was still behavior churn during the review of cargo-add.\r\n\r\n### Future Possibilities\r\n\r\nThe following are features which we might want to add to `cargo remove` in the future:\r\n\r\n- Add a `cargo rm` alias to ease transition for current cargo-edit users\r\n- Automatically convert between dash and underscores in deps: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/690\r\n- Remove unused dependencies: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/415\r\n- Clean up caches: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/647\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFixes #10520.\r\n",

Having both of their functionality together requires writing your own boilerplate for something that makes sense to have in the standard library. This PR adds the functionality of `io::Sink` to `io::Empty`, making `io::Empty` be able to perform the tasks of both of the previous structs. (This idea was first mentioned in #24235)\r\n\r\nNote: I also updated some doc comments in `io::utils` in this pull request to fix inconsistencies between `io::Sink` and `io::Empty`.\r\n\r\nAPI Change Proposal: https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/49",

In my opinion, the error type shares the name of the method (adjusted to accommodate both types of floats), which is consistent with other error types in `core`, `alloc` and `std` like `TryReserveError` and `TryFromIntError`.\r\n\r\n## Experience Report\r\n\r\nCode such as this is ready to be converted to a checked API to ensure it is panic free:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Time {\r\n    pub fn checked_add_f64(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<Self, TimeError> {\r\n        // Fail safely during `f64` conversion to duration\r\n        if seconds.is_nan() || seconds.is_infinite() {\r\n            return Err(TzOutOfRangeError::new().into());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if seconds.is_sign_positive() {\r\n            self.checked_add(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds))\r\n        } else {\r\n            self.checked_sub(Duration::from_secs_f64(-seconds))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/2194.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs\r\n\r\ncc @mbartlett21 ",

A full rationale can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918#issue-552884252. But in short: integer logarithms [are fairly common](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLog10), but require care to implement correctly, and effort to implement efficiently.\r\n\r\nBecause we expose `log` methods for floats it can be tempting for users to use that instead, which can lead to rounding errors. In the following example we're trying to calculate `base10` for an integer. We might try and calculate the `base2` for the values, and attempt [a base swap](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#log-rules) to arrive at `base10`. However because we're performing intermediate rounding we arrive at the wrong result:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// log10(900) = ~2.95 = 2\r\ndbg!(900f32.log10() as u64);\r\n    \r\n// log base change rule: logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)\r\n// log2(900) / log2(10) = 9/3 = 3, which is incorrect!\r\ndbg!((900f32.log2() as u64) / (10f32.log2() as u64));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.ilog(5), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.ilog2(), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.ilog10(), 1);\r\n\r\n// checked integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.checked_ilog(5), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.checked_ilog2(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.checked_ilog10(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(0_u64.checked_ilog(5), None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918\r\n- [x] Stabilization report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-1210602692\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Can we further optimize the `ilog10` implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-609976593\r\n- [x] Can we make these methods `const fn`?\r\n- [x] Can we implement these types for `NonZero{Int}`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611336828\r\n    - [x] Can we omit returning `Option` for `ilog2/ilog10` on `NonZero{Int}`?\r\n- [x] Should the methods be called `Integer::{ilog,ilog2,ilog10}` instead? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611998098 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-616580640\r\n\r\n## Implementation History\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835 - initial PR, closed due to inactivity\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918 - attempt 2 to implement `log` methods, merged\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92956 - `log` methods for `NonZero` types\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100332 - rename `log` methods to `ilog`\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102578 - panic on invalid args\r\n",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system as at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers, have to be rewriten as much as possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

                "body": "# Proposal\r\n\r\nStart an initiative with the goal of replacing the current trait system implementation of rustc. This new implementation should fully replace both `fulfill` and `evaluate` and offer an API a lot closer to the ideal of chalk/a-mir-formality.\r\n\r\n## Goals of this initiative\r\n\r\n- greatly simplify future changes to the trait system, unblocking features like marker traits and fixes for existing soundness bugs\r\n- better learnability, the current system is difficult to learn and understand\r\n- far better[^1] caching with an estimated impact of\r\n    - reducing compilation-time of some real world crates to less than half\r\n    - for less type-heavy crates 0% and 15% improvements\r\n    - in rare cases, may initially slightly worsen performance\r\n- reduces the chance of trait system bugs in the future\r\n\r\n[^1]: currently different `FnCtxt` do not share a cache for `fulfill` and also don't share it with mir borrowck.\r\n\r\n## Explicit non-goals of this initiative\r\n\r\nThis initiative does not intend to implement any major changes to the trait system as part of the replacement. The new replacement should closely mirror the old system as at the time of replacement to minimize the risk of backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nWe also do not intend to extract any shared code with rust-analyzer as part of this initiative. While that will be easier after this work has been completed, the sole focus of this initiative is to replace the existing solvers with a solver which results in the advantages noted above.\r\n\r\n## Outline of the planned work\r\n\r\nStart by clearly laying out how the compiler uses the existing trait solvers and what API has to be provided by the new solver.\r\n\r\nAny parts strongly tied to the architecture of the current solvers, have to be rewriten as much as possible. The biggest challenge will be trait diagnostics, which should be rewritten to be as solver agnostic as possible. Instead of relying on solver internals, diagnostics should lazily recompute necessary information where possible. This may require a reimplementation of our trait diagnostics to replace the existing one.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, work on a new solver directly in rustc to replace both `evaluate` and `fulfill`. When that solver is ready, replace all uses of evaluate and fulfill with the new solver and remove evaluate and fulfill. At that point this initiative can be closed again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see this [document](https://hackmd.io/3VogdqajTSOzR9NFLuMXsw#FAQ)\r\n\r\n# Initial members\r\n\r\n@lcnr as lead, other Types Team members depending on interest.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\n**This issue is not meant to be used for technical discussion. There is a Zulip stream for that. Use this issue to leave procedural comments, such as volunteering to review or raising a concern that you would like to be addressed.**\r\n",

Please consult with the team before\r\nopening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted\r\nwill be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThanks for submitting a pull request \ud83c\udf89! Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes #11251.\r\n\r\nThis adds a line like `Packaged 42 files, 727.0KiB (143.8KiB compressed)` to the output of `cargo package` and `cargo publish`. See the associated issue for more details.\r\n\r\n### Test info\r\n\r\nI've updated associated tests to account for the new line in the output, including the file count where relevant. I've also added a few additional tests specifically to address the uncompressed and compressed file sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test this manually, simply run `cargo package` or `cargo publish` within a project of your choice. The new `Packaged` line will appear at the end of the stderr output, or directly before the `Uploaded` line, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Review info\r\n\r\nThis PR touches many test files to account for the additional line of stderr output. For convenience, I've split the PR into 4 commits.\r\n1. contains the actual implementation\r\n2. updates existing tests unrelated to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`\r\n3. updates existing tests related to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`, including file counts where relevant\r\n4. adds new tests specifically for the file sizes, which are generally not covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe feature was discussed [on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Report.20crate.20size.20when.20packaging) prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nPotential future extensions to explore include:\r\n- Report size per file when using `--verbose`\r\n- Compare to the size of the previously uploaded version to warn if the increase is sufficiently large\r\n- Consider designs that can draw more attention to the most important information\r\n- Warn if large binary files are included ([#9058](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9058))",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "Previously a short circuiting binop chain would drop the first element after all the other elements, and otherwise follow evaluation order, so `f(1).g() && f(2).g() && f(3).g() && f(4).g()` would drop the temporaries in the order `2,3,4,1`. This made `&&` and `||` non-associative regarding drop order, so adding ()'s to the expression would change drop order: `f(1).g() && (f(2).g() && f(3).g()) && f(4).g()` for example would drop in the order `3,2,4,1`.\r\n\r\nAs, except for the bool result, there is no data returned by the sub-expressions of the short circuiting binops, we can safely discard of any temporaries created by the sub-expr. Previously, code was already putting the rhs's into terminating scopes, but missed it for the lhs's.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses this \"twist\". In the expression, we now also put the lhs into a terminating scope. The drop order of the above expressions is `1,2,3,4` now.\r\n\r\nThere might be code relying on the current order, and therefore I'd recommend doing a crater run to gauge the impact. I'd argue that such code is already quite wonky as it is one `foo() &&` addition away from breaking. ~~For the impact, I don't expect any *build* failures, as the compiler gets strictly more tolerant: shortening the lifetime of temporaries only expands the list of programs the compiler accepts as valid. There might be *runtime* failures caused by this change however.~~ Edit: both build and runtime failures are possible, e.g. see the example provided by dtolnay [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103293#issuecomment-1285341113).\r\n\r\nI've included a testcase that now compiles thanks to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe breakage is also limited to drop order relative to conditionals in the && chain: that is, in code like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nlet hello = foo().hi() && bar().world();\r\nprintln!(\"hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe already drop the temporaries of `foo().hi()` before we reach \"hi\".\r\n\r\nI'd ideally have this PR merged before let chains are stabilized. If this PR is taking too long, I'd love to have a more restricted version of this change limited to `&&`'s in let chains: the `&&`'s of such chains are quite special anyways as they accept `let` bindings, in there the `&&` is therefore more a part of the \"if let chain\" construct than a construct of its own.\r\n\r\nFixes #103107",

                "body": "WF check currently treats `WF(for<'a> fn(MyType<'a>))` differently from `for<'a> WF(MyType<'a>)`. The first one uses a bound variable when computing the WF requirements for `MyType`, while the second one first instantiates the bound variable with a placeholder. This means that currently, we emit WF requirements in the second case while discarding them for the first.\r\n\r\nHowever, checking WF for the second one is also broken by binders not having any implications. See `src/test/ui/wf/higher-ranked/on-impl.rs` which currently fails. ([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=46d4f2f24f152fc0361a9afc42efff1e)) This happens because `for<'a> &'a T` should mean `for<'a> where { T: 'a } &'a T` instead of `&'a T`. When adding implied bounds to `predicates_of`, this kind of issue happens pretty much all the time we have any higher ranked trait bound. We should therefore also skip nested obligations in wf if they have placeholders.\r\n\r\nAs long as we do not consider WF bounds for implied-bounds, this should not cause any additional unsoundness. It may allow for more instances of [an undesirable pattern](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=8991a3bfef466a8dd7b3ae9f03858074) but doing so is difficult. For impls, most of the time the **placeholders when using the impl** were **free regions when checking the impl**, at which point we did consider to nested obligations. It is possible using higher ranked bounds, see `src/test/ui/wf/higher-ranked/ignored-trait-bound.rs` where `HasWfPlaceholder` currently results in an error but is allowed with this PR.\r\n\r\nI don't expect this change to meaningfully impact the prevalence of this pattern. In our test suite there is a single existing test for which we now skip a nested obligation while there are far more tests where we discard candidates due to escaping bound vars. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d49e7e7fa13479c11a3733824c78e280e391288b/src/test/ui/higher-rank-trait-bounds/issue-95230.rs#L3-L7\r\n\r\nThis unblocks future work on implied bounds and feels like an acceptable band-aid until we can correctly deal with implications.\r\n\r\nr? types",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

A full rationale can be found in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918#issue-552884252. But in short: integer logarithms [are fairly common](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerLog10), but require care to implement correctly, and effort to implement efficiently.\r\n\r\nBecause we expose `log` methods for floats it can be tempting for users to use that instead, which can lead to rounding errors. In the following example we're trying to calculate `base10` for an integer. We might try and calculate the `base2` for the values, and attempt [a base swap](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#log-rules) to arrive at `base10`. However because we're performing intermediate rounding we arrive at the wrong result:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// log10(900) = ~2.95 = 2\r\ndbg!(900f32.log10() as u64);\r\n    \r\n// log base change rule: logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)\r\n// log2(900) / log2(10) = 9/3 = 3, which is incorrect!\r\ndbg!((900f32.log2() as u64) / (10f32.log2() as u64));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.ilog(5), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.ilog2(), 1);\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.ilog10(), 1);\r\n\r\n// checked integer log\r\nassert_eq!(5_u16.checked_ilog(5), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(2_u32.checked_ilog2(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(10_u32.checked_ilog10(), Some(1));\r\nassert_eq!(0_u64.checked_ilog(5), None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918\r\n- [x] Stabilization report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-1210602692\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Can we further optimize the `ilog10` implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-609976593\r\n- [x] Can we make these methods `const fn`?\r\n- [x] Can we implement these types for `NonZero{Int}`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611336828\r\n    - [x] Can we omit returning `Option` for `ilog2/ilog10` on `NonZero{Int}`?\r\n- [x] Should the methods be called `Integer::{ilog,ilog2,ilog10}` instead? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835#issuecomment-611998098 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70887#issuecomment-616580640\r\n\r\n## Implementation History\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70835 - initial PR, closed due to inactivity\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80918 - attempt 2 to implement `log` methods, merged\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92956 - `log` methods for `NonZero` types\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100332 - rename `log` methods to `ilog`\r\n",

Please consult with the team before\r\nopening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted\r\nwill be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThanks for submitting a pull request \ud83c\udf89! Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes #11251.\r\n\r\nThis adds a line like `Packaged 42 files, 727.0KiB (143.8KiB compressed)` to the output of `cargo package` and `cargo publish`. See the associated issue for more details.\r\n\r\n### Test info\r\n\r\nI've updated associated tests to account for the new line in the output, including the file count where relevant. I've also added a few additional tests specifically to address the uncompressed and compressed file sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test this manually, simply run `cargo package` or `cargo publish` within a project of your choice. The new `Packaged` line will appear at the end of the stderr output, or directly before the `Uploaded` line, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Review info\r\n\r\nThis PR touches many test files to account for the additional line of stderr output. For convenience, I've split the PR into 4 commits.\r\n1. contains the actual implementation\r\n2. updates existing tests unrelated to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`\r\n3. updates existing tests related to `cargo package` and `cargo publish`, including file counts where relevant\r\n4. adds new tests specifically for the file sizes, which are generally not covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe feature was discussed [on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Report.20crate.20size.20when.20packaging) prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nPotential future extensions to explore include:\r\n- Report size per file when using `--verbose`\r\n- Compare to the size of the previously uploaded version to warn if the increase is sufficiently large\r\n- Consider designs that can draw more attention to the most important information\r\n- Warn if large binary files are included ([#9058](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9058))",

I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

This leads to actual miscompilations with `futures::join!`.\r\n\r\nIMO the proper fix is to pin the closure when the future is pinned, which is achieved by changing the `Unpin` implementation. This is a breaking change though. 1.64.0 was *just* released, so maybe this is still okay?\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add some strong comments to the docs saying that closure captures are *not pinned* and doing `Pin::get_unchecked` on them is unsound.",

Having both of their functionality together requires writing your own boilerplate for something that makes sense to have in the standard library. This PR adds the functionality of `io::Sink` to `io::Empty`, making `io::Empty` be able to perform the tasks of both of the previous structs. (This idea was first mentioned in #24235)\r\n\r\nNote: I also updated some doc comments in `io::utils` in this pull request to fix inconsistencies between `io::Sink` and `io::Empty`.\r\n\r\nAPI Change Proposal: https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/49",

In my opinion, the error type shares the name of the method (adjusted to accommodate both types of floats), which is consistent with other error types in `core`, `alloc` and `std` like `TryReserveError` and `TryFromIntError`.\r\n\r\n## Experience Report\r\n\r\nCode such as this is ready to be converted to a checked API to ensure it is panic free:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Time {\r\n    pub fn checked_add_f64(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<Self, TimeError> {\r\n        // Fail safely during `f64` conversion to duration\r\n        if seconds.is_nan() || seconds.is_infinite() {\r\n            return Err(TzOutOfRangeError::new().into());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if seconds.is_sign_positive() {\r\n            self.checked_add(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds))\r\n        } else {\r\n            self.checked_sub(Duration::from_secs_f64(-seconds))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/2194.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs\r\n\r\ncc @mbartlett21 ",

                "body": "The documentation for `UnsafeCell<T>` currently does not make any promises about its memory layout. This PR adds this documentation, namely that the memory layout of `UnsafeCell<T>` is the same as the memory layout of its inner `T`.\r\n\r\n# Use case\r\nWithout this layout promise, the following cast would not be legally possible:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn example<T>(ptr: *mut T) -> *const UnsafeCell<T> {\r\n  ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA use case where this can come up involves FFI. If Rust receives a pointer over a FFI boundary which provides shared read-write access (with some form of custom synchronization), and this pointer is managed by some Rust struct with lifetime `'a`, then it would greatly simplify its (internal) API and safety contract if a `&'a UnsafeCell<T>` can be created from a raw FFI pointer `*mut T`. A lot of safety checks can be done when receiving the pointer for the first time through FFI (non-nullness, alignment, initialize uninit bytes, etc.) and these properties can then be encoded into the `&UnsafeCell<T>` type. Without this documentation guarantee, this is not legal today outside of the standard library.\r\n\r\n# Caveats\r\nCasting in the opposite direction is still not valid, even with this documentation change:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn example2<T>(ptr: &UnsafeCell<T>) -> &mut T {\r\n  let t = ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T> as *mut T;\r\n  unsafe { &mut *t }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the only legal way to obtain a mutable pointer to the contents of the shared reference is through [`UnsafeCell::get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.get) and [`UnsafeCell::raw_get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.raw_get). Although there might be a desire to also make this legal at some point in the future, that part is outside the scope of this PR. Also see this relevant [Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/136281-t-lang.2Fwg-unsafe-code-guidelines/topic/transmuting.20.26.20-.3E.20.26mut).\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\nInstead of adding a new documentation promise, it's also possible to add a new method to `UnsafeCell<T>` with signature `pub fn from_ptr_bikeshed(ptr: *mut T) -> *const UnsafeCell<T>` which indirectly only allows one-way casting to `*const UnsafeCell<T>`.",

I say interittent\r\nbecause it usually works until it doesn't and it is unclear why to the\r\nend user because it will be published by the time they check.  In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

In the\r\nend, callers tend to either put in timeouts (and pray), poll the\r\nserver's API, or use `crates-index` crate to poll the index.\r\n\r\nThis isn't sufficient because\r\n- For any new interested party, this is a pit of failure they'll fall\r\n  into\r\n- crates-index has re-implemented index support incorrectly in the past,\r\n  currently doesn't handle auth, doesn't support `git-cli`, etc.\r\n- None of these previous options work if we were to implement\r\n  workspace-publish support (#1169)\r\n- The new sparse registry might increase the publish times, making the\r\n  delay easier to hit manually\r\n- The new sparse registry goes through CDNs so checking the server's API\r\n  might not be sufficient\r\n- Once the sparse registry is available, crates-index users will find\r\n  out when the package is ready in git but it might not be ready through\r\n  the sparse registry because of CDNs\r\n\r\nSo now `cargo` will block until it sees the package in the index.\r\n- This is checking via the index instead of server APIs in case there\r\n  are propagation delays.  This has the side effect of being noisy\r\n  because of all of the \"Updating index\" messages.\r\n- This blocks by default but there is an unstable `publish.timeout` config field that will disable blocking when set to 0.  See #11222 for stablization\r\n\r\nBlocking is opt-out as that is the less error prone case for casual users while those doing larger integrations are also likely to do the testing needed to make more complicated scenarios work where blocking is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight now we block after the publish.  An alternative would be to block until all dependencies are in the index which makes the blocking only happen when needed\r\n- Blocking on dependencies can be imprecise to detect when to block vs propagate an error up\r\n- This is the less error prone case for users.  For example I recently publish a crate in one tab and immediately switched to another tab to use it and this only worked because `cargo-release` blocked until it was ready to use\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this change, be sure to look at the individual commits\r\n- The first makes it possible to write the tests for this\r\n- The second adds a test that shows the current behavior\r\n- The third updates the test to the expected behavior, showing all of this works\r\n\r\nIn addition to the publish tests:\r\n- We want to maximize the nightly-to-stable time to collect feedback\r\n- We will put this in TWiR's testing section to raise visibility\r\n\r\nFixes #9507",

                "body": "## What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nThis PR merges `cargo remove` from [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) into cargo.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n- General approval from community, see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5586 and https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10520.\r\n- Satisfying symmetry between add and remove.\r\n- Help users clean up their manifests (for example, when users forget to remove optional dependencies from feature lists).\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10472, cargo-add was added to cargo. As part of that discussion, it was also proposed that `cargo rm` (now `cargo remove`) eventually be added as well.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- Additional code always opens the door for more bugs and features\r\n  - The scope of this command is fairly small though\r\n  - Known bugs and most known features were resolved before this merge proposal\r\n\r\n### Behavior\r\n\r\n`cargo remove` operates on one or more dependencies from a manifest, removing them from a specified dependencies section (using the same flags as `cargo-add`) and from `[features]` activations if the dependency is optional. Feature lists themselves are not automatically removed when made empty.  Like with cargo-add, the lock file is automatically updated.\r\n\r\nNote: like `cargo add`, `cargo remove` refers to dependency names, rather than crate names, which can be different with the presence of the `name` field.\r\n\r\nNote: `cargo rm` has been renamed to `cargo remove`, based on prior art and user feedback (see [discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10520)). Although this renaming is arguably an improvement, adding an `rm` alias could make the switch easier for existing users of cargo-edit (at the cost of a naming conflict which would merit insta-stabilization).\r\n\r\n#### Help output\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  $ cargo run -- remove --help\r\n  cargo-remove\r\n  Remove dependencies from a Cargo.toml manifest file\r\n\r\n  USAGE:\r\n      cargo remove [OPTIONS] <DEP_ID>...\r\n\r\n  ARGS:\r\n      <DEP_ID>...

If you are interested in seeing how this feature evolved to better match cargo's internals, you might find the commit history there to be helpful. As this PR is reviewed, changes will be made both here and on that branch, with the commit history being fully maintained on the latter.\r\n\r\n`cargo remove` is structured like most other subcommands:\r\n\r\n- `src/bin/cargo/commands/remove.rs` contains the cli handling and top-level execution.\r\n- `src/cargo/ops/cargo_remove.rs` contains the implementation of the feature itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this feature, the `remove_from_table` util was added to `util::toml_mut::manifest::LocalManifest`.\r\n\r\nTests are split out into a separate commit to make it easier to review the production code and tests.  Tests have been implemented with `snapbox`, structured similarly to the tests of `cargo add`.\r\n\r\n### Prior art\r\n\r\n- Python: [`poetry remove`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#remove)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n- JavaScript: [`yarn remove`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/remove)\r\n  - Supports wildcards\r\n- JavaScript: [`pnpm remove`](https://pnpm.io/cli/remove)\r\n- Go: [`go get`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-get)\r\n  - `go get foo@none` to remove\r\n- Julia: [`pkg rm`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/)\r\n  - Supports `--all` to remove all dependencies\r\n- Ruby: [`bundle remove`](https://bundler.io/v2.2/man/bundle-remove.1.html)\r\n- Dart: [`dart pub remove`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-remove)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n- Lua: [`luarocks remove`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/remove)\r\n  - Supports force remove\r\n- .NET: [`Uninstall-Package`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n  - Supports removal of dependencies\r\n  - Supports force remove (disregards dependencies)\r\n- Haxe: [`haxelib remove`](https://lib.haxe.org/documentation/using-haxelib/#remove)\r\n- Racket: [`raco pkg remove`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-remove%29)\r\n  - Supports dry run\r\n  - Supports force remove (disregards dependencies)\r\n  - Supports demotion to weak dependency (sort of a corollary of force remove)\r\n\r\n### Insta-stabilization\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of `cargo add`'s stabilization story ([Zulip stream](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Stablizing.20cargo-add)), it was brought up that the feature might benefit from being insta-stabilized to avoid making the cargo-edit version of the binary hard to access. Since `cargo rm` (from cargo-edit) was renamed to `cargo remove` here, [such a conflict no longer exists](https://crates.io/search?q=cargo%20remove), so this is less of a concern.\r\n\r\nSince this feature is already has a had a long run of user testing in cargo-edit and doesn't have unsettled UI questions like cargo-add did, it might still be a candidate for insta-stabilization.\r\n\r\n### Deferred work\r\n\r\nNecessary future work:\r\n\r\n- Add documentation.\r\n- Add shell completions.\r\n- Perform GC on workspace dependencies when they are no longer used (see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8415).\r\n  - This is inspired by a feature from the RFC that was dropped (unused dependencies triggering a warning)\r\n  - This was deferred out to avoid challenges with testing nightly features\r\n\r\nIt was found in the review of `cargo add` that it was best to defer these first two items to focus the discussion and as there was still behavior churn during the review of cargo-add.\r\n\r\n### Future Possibilities\r\n\r\nThe following are features which we might want to add to `cargo remove` in the future:\r\n\r\n- Add a `cargo rm` alias to ease transition for current cargo-edit users\r\n- Automatically convert between dash and underscores in deps: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/690\r\n- Remove unused dependencies: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/415\r\n- Clean up caches: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/647\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFixes #10520.\r\n",

Having both of their functionality together requires writing your own boilerplate for something that makes sense to have in the standard library. This PR adds the functionality of `io::Sink` to `io::Empty`, making `io::Empty` be able to perform the tasks of both of the previous structs. (This idea was first mentioned in #24235)\r\n\r\nNote: I also updated some doc comments in `io::utils` in this pull request to fix inconsistencies between `io::Sink` and `io::Empty`.\r\n\r\nAPI Change Proposal: https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/49",

In my opinion, the error type shares the name of the method (adjusted to accommodate both types of floats), which is consistent with other error types in `core`, `alloc` and `std` like `TryReserveError` and `TryFromIntError`.\r\n\r\n## Experience Report\r\n\r\nCode such as this is ready to be converted to a checked API to ensure it is panic free:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Time {\r\n    pub fn checked_add_f64(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<Self, TimeError> {\r\n        // Fail safely during `f64` conversion to duration\r\n        if seconds.is_nan() || seconds.is_infinite() {\r\n            return Err(TzOutOfRangeError::new().into());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if seconds.is_sign_positive() {\r\n            self.checked_add(Duration::from_secs_f64(seconds))\r\n        } else {\r\n            self.checked_sub(Duration::from_secs_f64(-seconds))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/2194.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs\r\n\r\ncc @mbartlett21 ",
