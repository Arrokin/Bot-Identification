Please take a moment to review if it meets the following\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nBefore coding, it is recommended to create an issue to discuss the problem or feature\r\nyou want to add. If you did not, don't worry, we can discuss on the PR too.\r\n\r\nIf there is a pre-existing issue that your PR implements or fixes, add a pointer to it\r\nin the PR description.\r\n\r\nIf your PR is simple enough that it does not require a preliminary discussion, then make\r\nsure to explain what it does (i.e. _why_ the change is necessary).\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nDon't forget to add unit tests. If your PR fixes a bug, prefer creating a separate\r\ncommit for the test so we one see that your test reproduces the bug and is fixed by the\r\nPR.\r\n\r\n## Target branch\r\n\r\nMIS Builder is actively maintained for Odoo versions 9, 10, 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nIf your feature is applicable with the same implementation to all these versions, please\r\ntarget branch 10.0. Maintainers will port it to 9, 11 and 12 soon after merging.\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases your feature or implementation is specific to an Odoo version, then\r\ntarget the corresponding branch.\r\n\r\n## CLA\r\n\r\nHave you signed the OCA Contributor License Agreement? If not, please visit\r\nhttps://odoo-community.org/page/cla to learn how.\r\n\r\n## Changelog entry\r\n\r\nThis projects uses [towncrier](https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/) to generate it's\r\nchangelog. Make sure your PR includes a changelog entry in\r\n`<addon>/readme/newsfragments/`. It must have the issue or PR number as name, and one of\r\n`.feature`, `.bugfix`, `.doc` (for documentation improvements), `.misc` (if a ticket has\r\nbeen closed, but it is not of interest to users). The changelog entry must be reasonably\r\nshort and phrased in a way that is understandable by end users.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nConsider improving the documention in `docs/`.\r\n",

Please take a moment to review if it meets the following\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nBefore coding, it is recommended to create an issue to discuss the problem or feature\r\nyou want to add. If you did not, don't worry, we can discuss on the PR too.\r\n\r\nIf there is a pre-existing issue that your PR implements or fixes, add a pointer to it\r\nin the PR description.\r\n\r\nIf your PR is simple enough that it does not require a preliminary discussion, then make\r\nsure to explain what it does (i.e. _why_ the change is necessary).\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nDon't forget to add unit tests. If your PR fixes a bug, prefer creating a separate\r\ncommit for the test so we one see that your test reproduces the bug and is fixed by the\r\nPR.\r\n\r\n## Target branch\r\n\r\nMIS Builder is actively maintained for Odoo versions 9, 10, 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nIf your feature is applicable with the same implementation to all these versions, please\r\ntarget branch 10.0. Maintainers will port it to 9, 11 and 12 soon after merging.\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases your feature or implementation is specific to an Odoo version, then\r\ntarget the corresponding branch.\r\n\r\n## CLA\r\n\r\nHave you signed the OCA Contributor License Agreement? If not, please visit\r\nhttps://odoo-community.org/page/cla to learn how.\r\n\r\n## Changelog entry\r\n\r\nThis projects uses [towncrier](https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/) to generate it's\r\nchangelog. Make sure your PR includes a changelog entry in\r\n`<addon>/readme/newsfragments/`. It must have the issue or PR number as name, and one of\r\n`.feature`, `.bugfix`, `.doc` (for documentation improvements), `.misc` (if a ticket has\r\nbeen closed, but it is not of interest to users). The changelog entry must be reasonably\r\nshort and phrased in a way that is understandable by end users.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nConsider improving the documention in `docs/`.\r\n",

Please take a moment to review if it meets the following\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nBefore coding, it is recommended to create an issue to discuss the problem or feature\r\nyou want to add. If you did not, don't worry, we can discuss on the PR too.\r\n\r\nIf there is a pre-existing issue that your PR implements or fixes, add a pointer to it\r\nin the PR description.\r\n\r\nIf your PR is simple enough that it does not require a preliminary discussion, then make\r\nsure to explain what it does (i.e. _why_ the change is necessary).\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nDon't forget to add unit tests. If your PR fixes a bug, prefer creating a separate\r\ncommit for the test so we one see that your test reproduces the bug and is fixed by the\r\nPR.\r\n\r\n## Target branch\r\n\r\nMIS Builder is actively maintained for Odoo versions 9, 10, 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nIf your feature is applicable with the same implementation to all these versions, please\r\ntarget branch 10.0. Maintainers will port it to 9, 11 and 12 soon after merging.\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases your feature or implementation is specific to an Odoo version, then\r\ntarget the corresponding branch.\r\n\r\n## CLA\r\n\r\nHave you signed the OCA Contributor License Agreement? If not, please visit\r\nhttps://odoo-community.org/page/cla to learn how.\r\n\r\n## Changelog entry\r\n\r\nThis projects uses [towncrier](https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/) to generate it's\r\nchangelog. Make sure your PR includes a changelog entry in\r\n`<addon>/readme/newsfragments/`. It must have the issue or PR number as name, and one of\r\n`.feature`, `.bugfix`, `.doc` (for documentation improvements), `.misc` (if a ticket has\r\nbeen closed, but it is not of interest to users). The changelog entry must be reasonably\r\nshort and phrased in a way that is understandable by end users.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nConsider improving the documention in `docs/`.\r\n",
