Since I am new to dart, I am not sure if my implementation comply with this project's convention.\r\n\r\nThere are about 10 tests failed, which I think are expected since all of them are expecting failure or throw errors on mocking non-nullable methods. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, since we can support non-nullable return types now, a lots of related checking could be removed to make codebase simpler. \r\n\r\n#589 \r\n",

                "body": "As [discussed](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/discussions/284), I've written C bindings to facilitate bindings through FFI from static compiled languages. I've been writing bindings to Manifold from [OCaml](https://github.com/geoffder/OManifold) using these bindings to make sure that they work as intended. They aren't polished and fully documented yet, but the API is covered and integration with the garbage collector seems correct.\r\n\r\nThe changes mostly live under [bindings/c](https://github.com/geoffder/manifold/tree/cbind/bindings/c), but the Manifold build/source/API has been touched in a few places, namely:\r\n\r\n- sub-libraries are compiled as `OBJECT` and the `fPIC` flag is used when building the `c` bindings to allow more painless relocation of the archives/objects that is required for statically bundling them into executables in binding host languages (ran into this building the OCaml bindings)\r\n- GPU `ExecutionPolicy` is avoided when the sdf parameter to `LevelSet` is not a static lambda (results in runtime failure)\r\n- Optional control of `ExecutionPolicy` has been added to `LevelSet` to allow languages with thread/interpreter locks to avoid parallel access to the sdf closure\r\n- `Decompose` has been broken up to allow the `c` bindings to know how many `Manifold` allocations will be needed in advance without needing to repeat the expensive part of the method.",

Here we replace manual conversion of a package name and base file name with `ToCamel` func of the `github.com/iancoleman/strcase` package. This helper package has already been included in go.mod. `ToCamel` removes `.`, `-`, `_` or whitespace chars from the input string and uses those as a mark to capitalize the next letter.",

Since I am new to dart, I am not sure if my implementation comply with this project's convention.\r\n\r\nThere are about 10 tests failed, which I think are expected since all of them are expecting failure or throw errors on mocking non-nullable methods. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, since we can support non-nullable return types now, a lots of related checking could be removed to make codebase simpler. \r\n\r\n#589 \r\n",

I've been writing bindings to Manifold from [OCaml](https://github.com/geoffder/OManifold) using these bindings to make sure that they work as intended. They aren't polished and fully documented yet, but the API is covered and integration with the garbage collector seems correct.\r\n\r\nThe changes mostly live under [bindings/c](https://github.com/geoffder/manifold/tree/cbind/bindings/c), but the Manifold build/source/API has been touched in a few places, namely:\r\n\r\n- sub-libraries are compiled as `OBJECT` and the `fPIC` flag is used when building the `c` bindings to allow more painless relocation of the archives/objects that is required for statically bundling them into executables in binding host languages (ran into this building the OCaml bindings)\r\n- GPU `ExecutionPolicy` is avoided when the sdf parameter to `LevelSet` is not a static lambda (results in runtime failure)\r\n- Optional control of `ExecutionPolicy` has been added to `LevelSet` to allow languages with thread/interpreter locks to avoid parallel access to the sdf closure\r\n- `Decompose` has been broken up to allow the `c` bindings to know how many `Manifold` allocations will be needed in advance without needing to repeat the expensive part of the method.",

Here we replace manual conversion of a package name and base file name with `ToCamel` func of the `github.com/iancoleman/strcase` package. This helper package has already been included in go.mod. `ToCamel` removes `.`, `-`, `_` or whitespace chars from the input string and uses those as a mark to capitalize the next letter.",

Since I am new to dart, I am not sure if my implementation comply with this project's convention.\r\n\r\nThere are about 10 tests failed, which I think are expected since all of them are expecting failure or throw errors on mocking non-nullable methods. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, since we can support non-nullable return types now, a lots of related checking could be removed to make codebase simpler. \r\n\r\n#589 \r\n",

I've been writing bindings to Manifold from [OCaml](https://github.com/geoffder/OManifold) using these bindings to make sure that they work as intended. They aren't polished and fully documented yet, but the API is covered and integration with the garbage collector seems correct.\r\n\r\nThe changes mostly live under [bindings/c](https://github.com/geoffder/manifold/tree/cbind/bindings/c), but the Manifold build/source/API has been touched in a few places, namely:\r\n\r\n- sub-libraries are compiled as `OBJECT` and the `fPIC` flag is used when building the `c` bindings to allow more painless relocation of the archives/objects that is required for statically bundling them into executables in binding host languages (ran into this building the OCaml bindings)\r\n- GPU `ExecutionPolicy` is avoided when the sdf parameter to `LevelSet` is not a static lambda (results in runtime failure)\r\n- Optional control of `ExecutionPolicy` has been added to `LevelSet` to allow languages with thread/interpreter locks to avoid parallel access to the sdf closure\r\n- `Decompose` has been broken up to allow the `c` bindings to know how many `Manifold` allocations will be needed in advance without needing to repeat the expensive part of the method.",

Here we replace manual conversion of a package name and base file name with `ToCamel` func of the `github.com/iancoleman/strcase` package. This helper package has already been included in go.mod. `ToCamel` removes `.`, `-`, `_` or whitespace chars from the input string and uses those as a mark to capitalize the next letter.",
