Since we had nesting of components as well, we were ending up duplicating the code. \r\n\r\nHence we used the optimization block inside the config.\r\n```\r\noptimization: {\r\n    splitChunks: {\r\n      chunks: 'all',\r\n      minChunks: 1,\r\n      minSize: 1000,\r\n      maxInitialRequests: Infinity,\r\n      cacheGroups: {\r\n        vendorCss: {\r\n          test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](@hotstar\\/isomorphic-style-loader|css-loader)[\\\\/]/,\r\n          name: 'vendor_css_loaders',\r\n          chunks: 'all',\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut after using this to bundle our components lib, and using this library inside the next.js app we get the error\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property '__esModule' of undefined\r\n    at /Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/node_modules/@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src/index.js:328:34\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/node_modules/@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src/index.js:330:12)\r\n    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1085:14)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1114:10)\r\n    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:950:32)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:790:12)\r\n    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:974:19)\r\n    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:93:18)\r\n    at Object.@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/packages/website/.next/server/pages/_app.js:1273:18)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/packages/website/.next/server/webpack-runtime.js:33:42)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich arises from here at 192 line.\r\n![Screenshot 2022-08-04 at 12 34 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85304785/182784693-1eb46b9f-6478-47e2-aeaa-b3ec4682eff6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n Mentioned above\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should run without giving any errors\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.40\r\nNode.js version:  14.0.0\r\nOperating System: mac os\r\nnext.js version: 12.0.7\r\n\r\n",

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Source maps provide a reasonable debugging experience at runtime, but when analyzing an exception, it's difficult to reconstruct an unminified stack trace, even with V3 source maps available. The best case of this often is that the token at the point of the error can be discovered, so a language parser will need to walk backward from that token to try to find a function declaration to get the name.\r\n\r\nConsider a tiny example such as this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction causeError() {\r\n  throw new Error('Expected failure.');\r\n}\r\ncauseError();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon minification, this might become:\r\n```js\r\n(()=>{throw new Error('Expected failure.')})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA plain rendering of this in an error stack might look like:\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at example.js:1:13\r\n    at example.js:1:45\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith source maps, we can get a pretty reasonable output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at example-src.js:2:3\r\n    at example-src.js:4:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the token at 2:3 is `throw`. That isn't terribly useful. If I reconstructed that stack by hand, I would expect:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at causeError (example-src.js:2:3)\r\n    at Global code (example-src.js:4:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo that end, the Edge DevTools team are proposing a v4 of Source Maps that will support this by encoding a notion of \"scopes\" -- source text ranges that correspond to a given runtime name. This is at MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers#538.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nWe've seen other tools that do this -- https://github.com/bloomberg/pasta-sourcemaps as an example -- but if we can standardize this, we can incorporate that functionality into our everyday developer tools.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nThe spec proposes that the `scopes` field would be comprised of a list 6 VLQs for each scope name mapping:\r\n - Source index\r\n - Start line\r\n - Start column\r\n - End line\r\n - End column\r\n - Scope name index\r\n\r\nGiven an input source map from a tool like TypeScript already producing these values, the only thing a tool like Webpack would need to do is combine all of them, in this case, combining and de-duping the `scopeNames` field, and providing a small amount of modification (updating the source index and scope name index) when combining all of the various `scopes` values from each of the input source maps.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nYes. And, I've been working on producing this in TypeScript as well -- microsoft/typescript#47152\r\n",

After my investigation it's caused by different `moduleIds`.\r\nI take an experiment to prove it. \r\nFirst, I saved my project in two version while their `monaco-editor` versions are identity. When I used the `moduleIds: 'named'` and built my  project in prod env. They got the same content hash. \r\nBut when I changed the `modulesIds` to an Id type, e.g. 'deterministic', 'size'. They got different hash values. \r\nI did not have idea for why it happened since it was hard to read in prod env. But I think it was caused by importing different modules.\r\nHowever, the dependencies's content are identity. So I expect the content hash will be identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nHash content should not be disturbed by `moduleIds`.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nTo avoid the content hash being disturbed by moduleIds\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nHash content before moduleIds optimization will avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nno\r\n",

This way, users that are in the middle of a git rebase or want to pause compilation by any means, can do that. In addition, it would be nice to have a interactive terminal where you can specify watch mode, what files to compile and such.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a functional interactive CLI first, look at how [`jest watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#running-from-the-command-line) is doing this.\r\n\r\n![skjermbilde 2018-09-15 kl 10 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16735925/45584235-58f59d00-b8d0-11e8-887b-38b7a18e4316.png)\r\n \r\nThe features that should be available would be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 m: filter modules\r\n\u2022 p: pause watching (i. e. when doing git actions)\r\n\u2022 r: reload configuration and restart webpack\r\n\u2022 c: clear cache and recompile\r\n\u2022 e: explore mode to interactively walk the module/chunk graph to find out why a module is included\r\n\u2022 w: select a module and print out why it's included\r\n\u2022 q: quit\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis PR should go against the branch #527 is pointed towards. Feel free to reach out to any of the CLI members to get assistance in implementing this!\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do, is to implement the logic for the command, which should be done as a method [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/refactor-bin-folder/lib/commands/internal.js#L1)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking! \ud83d\udc99 ",

                "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs apart of the new CLI, one thing that would be nice to have is a `webpack interactive` command. This way, users that are in the middle of a git rebase or want to pause compilation by any means, can do that. In addition, it would be nice to have a interactive terminal where you can specify watch mode, what files to compile and such.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a functional interactive CLI first, look at how [`jest watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#running-from-the-command-line) is doing this.\r\n\r\n![skjermbilde 2018-09-15 kl 10 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16735925/45584235-58f59d00-b8d0-11e8-887b-38b7a18e4316.png)\r\n \r\nThe features that should be available would be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 m: filter modules\r\n\u2022 p: pause watching (i. e. when doing git actions)\r\n\u2022 r: reload configuration and restart webpack\r\n\u2022 c: clear cache and recompile\r\n\u2022 e: explore mode to interactively walk the module/chunk graph to find out why a module is included\r\n\u2022 w: select a module and print out why it's included\r\n\u2022 q: quit\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis PR should go against the branch #527 is pointed towards. Feel free to reach out to any of the CLI members to get assistance in implementing this!\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do, is to implement the logic for the command, which should be done as a method [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/refactor-bin-folder/lib/commands/internal.js#L1)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking! \ud83d\udc99 ",

It happens when both bundles use the same third party library, but each one imports a different code from that library. The actual result is that the main bundle includes both of the imported codes from the third party library.\r\n\r\nFor example, using React: \r\n\r\nThis is the entry point of webpack: index.js\r\n```\r\nimport { Component1 } from 'third-party-components-library';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport loadable from '@loadable/component';\r\n\r\nexport const MainComponent = () => {\r\n  const LoadableComponent = loadable(() => import('./LoadableComponent'));\r\n  return (\r\n    <Component1>\r\n      <LoadableComponent />\r\n    </Component1>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis is the loadable component: LoadableComponent.js \r\n```\r\nimport { Component2 } from 'third-party-components-library';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst LoadableComponent = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Component2/>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport default LoadableComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo separated bundles are created:  First for index.js, which is the webpack entry point,  and the second for LoadableComponent.js. The first one includes both codes for Component1 and Component2 from \u2018third-party-components-library\u2019. The second one doesn\u2019t include any code from \u2018third-party-components-library\u2019. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nUse the loadable-components library via its webpack plugin:\r\nhttps://loadable-components.com/docs/getting-started/\r\nhttps://loadable-components.com/docs/api-loadable-webpack-plugin/\r\nThe main bundle, which is the bundle that is created from the webpack entrypoint, should import a component from a third party library. The main bundle should include a loadable-component. The loadable-component should import a different component from the same third party library.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected behavior is that webpack will split the code between the main bundle and the loadable bundle in a way that each bundle includes only the relevant code from the third party library.\r\nIn the context of the previous example:\r\nThe main bundle (for index.js entry point) should include only the code for Component1 from 'third-party-components-library' and the second bundle (for LoadableComponent.js) should include only the code for Component2 from 'third-party-components-library'.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.0.0\r\nNode.js version: 12.18.0\r\nOperating System: \r\nAdditional tools:",

After profiling the code, I've found that `createHash` was adding most of the time to the processing.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it in synthetic tests. My current assumption is that high memory pressure and GC are involved. I can investigate it later but would like the fix to be checked in.\r\n\r\nWe use `webpack-subresource-integrity` plugin, half of the hashes come form it and are recalculated through the hook. Since `hash` is only needed when there wasn't one generated by an external plugin, it's safe to move its creation into the same conditional block, where it's used. \r\n\r\nThis minor change improved `RealContentHashPlugin` processing time by **5x**:\r\n\r\n_Note: timing is provided by `ProfilingPlugin`_\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n_OS:_ Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n_CPU:_ Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL @ 2.60Ghz\r\n_MEM:_ 64GB\r\n_Node.js:_ 14.20.0\r\n_Hashing Algorithm:_ `xxhash64`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 34% (559s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 31% (741s)`\r\nRun 3: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 33% (587s)`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (93s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (95s)`\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\nRefactoring.

After profiling the code, I've found that `createHash` was adding most of the time to the processing.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it in synthetic tests. My current assumption is that high memory pressure and GC are involved. I can investigate it later but would like the fix to be checked in.\r\n\r\nWe use `webpack-subresource-integrity` plugin, half of the hashes come form it and are recalculated through the hook. Since `hash` is only needed when there wasn't one generated by an external plugin, it's safe to move its creation into the same conditional block, where it's used. \r\n\r\nThis minor change improved `RealContentHashPlugin` processing time by **5x**:\r\n\r\n_Note: timing is provided by `ProfilingPlugin`_\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n_OS:_ Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n_CPU:_ Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL @ 2.60Ghz\r\n_MEM:_ 64GB\r\n_Node.js:_ 14.20.0\r\n_Hashing Algorithm:_ `xxhash64`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 34% (559s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 31% (741s)`\r\nRun 3: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 33% (587s)`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (93s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (95s)`\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\nRefactoring.

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

It would be great to continue using npm to manage dependencies but to have the option to output the dependencies into a directory tree that can be accessed by web server and loaded directly by the browser, on a per file on demand basis. \r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nPerhaps just a configuration switch like static_file_tree=true or browser_direct_es6_static_dir=on\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nIt seems this kind of thing would require wizard level.\r\n\r\n",

With some typical config, I succeed in the code-splitting in a \"_multi JS + single CSS_\" style. \r\n\r\nHowever, although the `mini-css-extract-plugin` only generates a single CSS file, the generated entry ESM is still trying to import the JS file with the same chunk name. This will cause runtime error in browsers. The ESM will fail to initialize due to the following error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    :8080/styles.js:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11671, the key difference in this issue is `outputModule: true` I think. I've done some debugging on my own but no lock, any guidance will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nPlease checkout https://github.com/evisong/testcase-webpack-esm-css-extract,\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\n```log\r\n$ webpack serve --mode development --no-hot\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv4): http://172.24.49.91:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv6): http://[fe80::1]:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from 'public, dist' directory\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-middleware] wait until bundle finished: /\r\nasset vendors-node_modules_webpack-dev-server_client_index_js_protocol_ws_3A_hostname_0_0_0_0_port_-262e74.js 193 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (id hint: vendors)\r\nasset runtime.js 4.93 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: runtime)\r\nasset esm.js 4.36 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: esm)\r\nasset styles.css 493 bytes [emitted] (name: styles) (id hint: styles)\r\nEntrypoint esm 203 KiB = runtime.js 4.93 KiB styles.css 493 bytes vendors-node_modules_webpack-dev-server_client_index_js_protocol_ws_3A_hostname_0_0_0_0_port_-262e74.js 193 KiB esm.js 4.36 KiB\r\nruntime modules 3.73 KiB 15 modules\r\norphan modules 3.23 KiB [orphan] 4 modules\r\njavascript modules 154 KiB\r\n  modules by path ./node_modules/ 154 KiB 20 modules\r\n  modules by path ./src/ 437 bytes\r\n    modules by path ./src/*.js 337 bytes 3 modules\r\n    modules by path ./src/*.css 100 bytes\r\n      ./src/app-a.css 50 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n      ./src/app-b.css 50 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\ncss modules 67 bytes\r\n  css ./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/app-a.css 33 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n  css ./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/app-b.css 34 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\nwebpack 5.72.0 compiled successfully in 514 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nVisit http://localhost:8080/ in browser, the DevTools -> Console shows an error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    :8080/styles.js:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nDouble-check in DevTools -> Network, the resource is missing:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nRequest URL: http://localhost:8080/styles.js\r\nRequest Method: GET\r\nStatus Code: 404 Not Found\r\nRemote Address: [::1]:8080\r\nReferrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut its reference appears at the bottom the `http://localhost:8080/esm.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ...\r\nimport * as __webpack_chunk_0__ from \"./styles.js\";\r\n__webpack_require__.C(__webpack_chunk_0__);\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe entry ESM bundle `http://localhost:8080/esm.js` should not import anything from the nonexisting `styles.js`.\r\n\r\nAccording to a quick debug, in [webpack/lib/esm/ModuleChunkFormatPlugin.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/d3a0f8de03f26a83b4d5db3cfe177617a3801df3/lib/esm/ModuleChunkFormatPlugin.js#L144-L161), the `import` code for `styles` chunk (containing both `javascript` and `css/mini-extract` modules) is rendered just like the other chunks.

Project is monorepo with several (or more) packages where every one of them is compiled to single js file. Packages are quite big (result file is about 1-2 Mb). node_modules are hoisted to root and can be effectivly cached between all packages.\r\n2. Build is almost always production and not in watch mode.\r\n3. We need to somehow reduce compilation time of all packages. Especially in CI.\r\n4. Separate cache for every package is not efficient in terms of time: in CI it's not helping and memory: we have server and client builds and cache for them is about 100 Mb for one package\r\n5. Multiple entries not share they memory cache (at least that what it's looks like when i try that) and even result to build hang.\r\n\r\nSo this solution looks pretty light and bring our build with webpack 5 to be at least not slower than with webpack 4, which, in turns, will allow us to move to webpack 5.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nFlag `cache.readonly` in config, which is disable cache store in store method of `PackFileCacheStrategy`\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nyes\r\n",

The webassembly binary is apart of an npm package that my project depends on.\r\n\r\nSometimes I want to build that webassembly library locally, and when I do, I `yarn link` the other package to my webpack project. I also build a debug version of the webassembly binary which is much bigger than the one that is used otherwise (hundreds of MBs).\r\n\r\nIn this linked mode, every time I rebuild the webassembly binary, it triggers the hot reloader, and fails with this trace:\r\n```\r\n<e> [webpack-dev-middleware] HookWebpackError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at makeWebpackError (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/HookWebpackError.js:48:9)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:3060:12\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:20:1)\r\n<e>     at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n<e> -- inner error --\r\n<e> TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at WeakMap.set (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at toCachedSource (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:70:18)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:148:28\r\n<e>     at fn (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:536:19)\r\n<e>     at _next8 (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:12:17)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:29:1)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:11:1)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/SourceMapDevToolPlugin.js:549:10\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2830:7\r\n<e>     at Object.each (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2857:9)\r\n<e> caused by plugins in Compilation.hooks.processAssets\r\n<e> TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at WeakMap.set (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at toCachedSource (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:70:18)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:148:28\r\n<e>     at fn (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:536:19)\r\n<e>     at _next8 (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:12:17)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:29:1)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:11:1)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/SourceMapDevToolPlugin.js:549:10\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2830:7\r\n<e>     at Object.each (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2857:9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I kill the dev server and restart it, all is fine.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI don't have a good way to reproduce this just yet.

Since we had nesting of components as well, we were ending up duplicating the code. \r\n\r\nHence we used the optimization block inside the config.\r\n```\r\noptimization: {\r\n    splitChunks: {\r\n      chunks: 'all',\r\n      minChunks: 1,\r\n      minSize: 1000,\r\n      maxInitialRequests: Infinity,\r\n      cacheGroups: {\r\n        vendorCss: {\r\n          test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](@hotstar\\/isomorphic-style-loader|css-loader)[\\\\/]/,\r\n          name: 'vendor_css_loaders',\r\n          chunks: 'all',\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut after using this to bundle our components lib, and using this library inside the next.js app we get the error\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property '__esModule' of undefined\r\n    at /Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/node_modules/@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src/index.js:328:34\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/node_modules/@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src/index.js:330:12)\r\n    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1085:14)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1114:10)\r\n    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:950:32)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:790:12)\r\n    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:974:19)\r\n    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:93:18)\r\n    at Object.@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/packages/website/.next/server/pages/_app.js:1273:18)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/packages/website/.next/server/webpack-runtime.js:33:42)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich arises from here at 192 line.\r\n![Screenshot 2022-08-04 at 12 34 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85304785/182784693-1eb46b9f-6478-47e2-aeaa-b3ec4682eff6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n Mentioned above\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should run without giving any errors\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.40\r\nNode.js version:  14.0.0\r\nOperating System: mac os\r\nnext.js version: 12.0.7\r\n\r\n",

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Source maps provide a reasonable debugging experience at runtime, but when analyzing an exception, it's difficult to reconstruct an unminified stack trace, even with V3 source maps available. The best case of this often is that the token at the point of the error can be discovered, so a language parser will need to walk backward from that token to try to find a function declaration to get the name.\r\n\r\nConsider a tiny example such as this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction causeError() {\r\n  throw new Error('Expected failure.');\r\n}\r\ncauseError();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon minification, this might become:\r\n```js\r\n(()=>{throw new Error('Expected failure.')})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA plain rendering of this in an error stack might look like:\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at example.js:1:13\r\n    at example.js:1:45\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith source maps, we can get a pretty reasonable output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at example-src.js:2:3\r\n    at example-src.js:4:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the token at 2:3 is `throw`. That isn't terribly useful. If I reconstructed that stack by hand, I would expect:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at causeError (example-src.js:2:3)\r\n    at Global code (example-src.js:4:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo that end, the Edge DevTools team are proposing a v4 of Source Maps that will support this by encoding a notion of \"scopes\" -- source text ranges that correspond to a given runtime name. This is at MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers#538.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nWe've seen other tools that do this -- https://github.com/bloomberg/pasta-sourcemaps as an example -- but if we can standardize this, we can incorporate that functionality into our everyday developer tools.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nThe spec proposes that the `scopes` field would be comprised of a list 6 VLQs for each scope name mapping:\r\n - Source index\r\n - Start line\r\n - Start column\r\n - End line\r\n - End column\r\n - Scope name index\r\n\r\nGiven an input source map from a tool like TypeScript already producing these values, the only thing a tool like Webpack would need to do is combine all of them, in this case, combining and de-duping the `scopeNames` field, and providing a small amount of modification (updating the source index and scope name index) when combining all of the various `scopes` values from each of the input source maps.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nYes. And, I've been working on producing this in TypeScript as well -- microsoft/typescript#47152\r\n",

After my investigation it's caused by different `moduleIds`.\r\nI take an experiment to prove it. \r\nFirst, I saved my project in two version while their `monaco-editor` versions are identity. When I used the `moduleIds: 'named'` and built my  project in prod env. They got the same content hash. \r\nBut when I changed the `modulesIds` to an Id type, e.g. 'deterministic', 'size'. They got different hash values. \r\nI did not have idea for why it happened since it was hard to read in prod env. But I think it was caused by importing different modules.\r\nHowever, the dependencies's content are identity. So I expect the content hash will be identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nHash content should not be disturbed by `moduleIds`.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nTo avoid the content hash being disturbed by moduleIds\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nHash content before moduleIds optimization will avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nno\r\n",

This way, users that are in the middle of a git rebase or want to pause compilation by any means, can do that. In addition, it would be nice to have a interactive terminal where you can specify watch mode, what files to compile and such.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a functional interactive CLI first, look at how [`jest watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#running-from-the-command-line) is doing this.\r\n\r\n![skjermbilde 2018-09-15 kl 10 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16735925/45584235-58f59d00-b8d0-11e8-887b-38b7a18e4316.png)\r\n \r\nThe features that should be available would be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 m: filter modules\r\n\u2022 p: pause watching (i. e. when doing git actions)\r\n\u2022 r: reload configuration and restart webpack\r\n\u2022 c: clear cache and recompile\r\n\u2022 e: explore mode to interactively walk the module/chunk graph to find out why a module is included\r\n\u2022 w: select a module and print out why it's included\r\n\u2022 q: quit\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis PR should go against the branch #527 is pointed towards. Feel free to reach out to any of the CLI members to get assistance in implementing this!\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do, is to implement the logic for the command, which should be done as a method [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/refactor-bin-folder/lib/commands/internal.js#L1)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking! \ud83d\udc99 ",

                "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs apart of the new CLI, one thing that would be nice to have is a `webpack interactive` command. This way, users that are in the middle of a git rebase or want to pause compilation by any means, can do that. In addition, it would be nice to have a interactive terminal where you can specify watch mode, what files to compile and such.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a functional interactive CLI first, look at how [`jest watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#running-from-the-command-line) is doing this.\r\n\r\n![skjermbilde 2018-09-15 kl 10 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16735925/45584235-58f59d00-b8d0-11e8-887b-38b7a18e4316.png)\r\n \r\nThe features that should be available would be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 m: filter modules\r\n\u2022 p: pause watching (i. e. when doing git actions)\r\n\u2022 r: reload configuration and restart webpack\r\n\u2022 c: clear cache and recompile\r\n\u2022 e: explore mode to interactively walk the module/chunk graph to find out why a module is included\r\n\u2022 w: select a module and print out why it's included\r\n\u2022 q: quit\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis PR should go against the branch #527 is pointed towards. Feel free to reach out to any of the CLI members to get assistance in implementing this!\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do, is to implement the logic for the command, which should be done as a method [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/refactor-bin-folder/lib/commands/internal.js#L1)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking! \ud83d\udc99 ",

It happens when both bundles use the same third party library, but each one imports a different code from that library. The actual result is that the main bundle includes both of the imported codes from the third party library.\r\n\r\nFor example, using React: \r\n\r\nThis is the entry point of webpack: index.js\r\n```\r\nimport { Component1 } from 'third-party-components-library';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport loadable from '@loadable/component';\r\n\r\nexport const MainComponent = () => {\r\n  const LoadableComponent = loadable(() => import('./LoadableComponent'));\r\n  return (\r\n    <Component1>\r\n      <LoadableComponent />\r\n    </Component1>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis is the loadable component: LoadableComponent.js \r\n```\r\nimport { Component2 } from 'third-party-components-library';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst LoadableComponent = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Component2/>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport default LoadableComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo separated bundles are created:  First for index.js, which is the webpack entry point,  and the second for LoadableComponent.js. The first one includes both codes for Component1 and Component2 from \u2018third-party-components-library\u2019. The second one doesn\u2019t include any code from \u2018third-party-components-library\u2019. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nUse the loadable-components library via its webpack plugin:\r\nhttps://loadable-components.com/docs/getting-started/\r\nhttps://loadable-components.com/docs/api-loadable-webpack-plugin/\r\nThe main bundle, which is the bundle that is created from the webpack entrypoint, should import a component from a third party library. The main bundle should include a loadable-component. The loadable-component should import a different component from the same third party library.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected behavior is that webpack will split the code between the main bundle and the loadable bundle in a way that each bundle includes only the relevant code from the third party library.\r\nIn the context of the previous example:\r\nThe main bundle (for index.js entry point) should include only the code for Component1 from 'third-party-components-library' and the second bundle (for LoadableComponent.js) should include only the code for Component2 from 'third-party-components-library'.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.0.0\r\nNode.js version: 12.18.0\r\nOperating System: \r\nAdditional tools:",

After profiling the code, I've found that `createHash` was adding most of the time to the processing.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it in synthetic tests. My current assumption is that high memory pressure and GC are involved. I can investigate it later but would like the fix to be checked in.\r\n\r\nWe use `webpack-subresource-integrity` plugin, half of the hashes come form it and are recalculated through the hook. Since `hash` is only needed when there wasn't one generated by an external plugin, it's safe to move its creation into the same conditional block, where it's used. \r\n\r\nThis minor change improved `RealContentHashPlugin` processing time by **5x**:\r\n\r\n_Note: timing is provided by `ProfilingPlugin`_\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n_OS:_ Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n_CPU:_ Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL @ 2.60Ghz\r\n_MEM:_ 64GB\r\n_Node.js:_ 14.20.0\r\n_Hashing Algorithm:_ `xxhash64`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 34% (559s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 31% (741s)`\r\nRun 3: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 33% (587s)`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (93s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (95s)`\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\nRefactoring.

After profiling the code, I've found that `createHash` was adding most of the time to the processing.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it in synthetic tests. My current assumption is that high memory pressure and GC are involved. I can investigate it later but would like the fix to be checked in.\r\n\r\nWe use `webpack-subresource-integrity` plugin, half of the hashes come form it and are recalculated through the hook. Since `hash` is only needed when there wasn't one generated by an external plugin, it's safe to move its creation into the same conditional block, where it's used. \r\n\r\nThis minor change improved `RealContentHashPlugin` processing time by **5x**:\r\n\r\n_Note: timing is provided by `ProfilingPlugin`_\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n_OS:_ Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n_CPU:_ Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL @ 2.60Ghz\r\n_MEM:_ 64GB\r\n_Node.js:_ 14.20.0\r\n_Hashing Algorithm:_ `xxhash64`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 34% (559s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 31% (741s)`\r\nRun 3: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 33% (587s)`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (93s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (95s)`\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\nRefactoring.

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

It would be great to continue using npm to manage dependencies but to have the option to output the dependencies into a directory tree that can be accessed by web server and loaded directly by the browser, on a per file on demand basis. \r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nPerhaps just a configuration switch like static_file_tree=true or browser_direct_es6_static_dir=on\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nIt seems this kind of thing would require wizard level.\r\n\r\n",

With some typical config, I succeed in the code-splitting in a \"_multi JS + single CSS_\" style. \r\n\r\nHowever, although the `mini-css-extract-plugin` only generates a single CSS file, the generated entry ESM is still trying to import the JS file with the same chunk name. This will cause runtime error in browsers. The ESM will fail to initialize due to the following error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    :8080/styles.js:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11671, the key difference in this issue is `outputModule: true` I think. I've done some debugging on my own but no lock, any guidance will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nPlease checkout https://github.com/evisong/testcase-webpack-esm-css-extract,\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\n```log\r\n$ webpack serve --mode development --no-hot\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv4): http://172.24.49.91:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv6): http://[fe80::1]:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from 'public, dist' directory\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-middleware] wait until bundle finished: /\r\nasset vendors-node_modules_webpack-dev-server_client_index_js_protocol_ws_3A_hostname_0_0_0_0_port_-262e74.js 193 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (id hint: vendors)\r\nasset runtime.js 4.93 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: runtime)\r\nasset esm.js 4.36 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: esm)\r\nasset styles.css 493 bytes [emitted] (name: styles) (id hint: styles)\r\nEntrypoint esm 203 KiB = runtime.js 4.93 KiB styles.css 493 bytes vendors-node_modules_webpack-dev-server_client_index_js_protocol_ws_3A_hostname_0_0_0_0_port_-262e74.js 193 KiB esm.js 4.36 KiB\r\nruntime modules 3.73 KiB 15 modules\r\norphan modules 3.23 KiB [orphan] 4 modules\r\njavascript modules 154 KiB\r\n  modules by path ./node_modules/ 154 KiB 20 modules\r\n  modules by path ./src/ 437 bytes\r\n    modules by path ./src/*.js 337 bytes 3 modules\r\n    modules by path ./src/*.css 100 bytes\r\n      ./src/app-a.css 50 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n      ./src/app-b.css 50 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\ncss modules 67 bytes\r\n  css ./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/app-a.css 33 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n  css ./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/app-b.css 34 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\nwebpack 5.72.0 compiled successfully in 514 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nVisit http://localhost:8080/ in browser, the DevTools -> Console shows an error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    :8080/styles.js:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nDouble-check in DevTools -> Network, the resource is missing:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nRequest URL: http://localhost:8080/styles.js\r\nRequest Method: GET\r\nStatus Code: 404 Not Found\r\nRemote Address: [::1]:8080\r\nReferrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut its reference appears at the bottom the `http://localhost:8080/esm.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ...\r\nimport * as __webpack_chunk_0__ from \"./styles.js\";\r\n__webpack_require__.C(__webpack_chunk_0__);\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe entry ESM bundle `http://localhost:8080/esm.js` should not import anything from the nonexisting `styles.js`.\r\n\r\nAccording to a quick debug, in [webpack/lib/esm/ModuleChunkFormatPlugin.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/d3a0f8de03f26a83b4d5db3cfe177617a3801df3/lib/esm/ModuleChunkFormatPlugin.js#L144-L161), the `import` code for `styles` chunk (containing both `javascript` and `css/mini-extract` modules) is rendered just like the other chunks.

Project is monorepo with several (or more) packages where every one of them is compiled to single js file. Packages are quite big (result file is about 1-2 Mb). node_modules are hoisted to root and can be effectivly cached between all packages.\r\n2. Build is almost always production and not in watch mode.\r\n3. We need to somehow reduce compilation time of all packages. Especially in CI.\r\n4. Separate cache for every package is not efficient in terms of time: in CI it's not helping and memory: we have server and client builds and cache for them is about 100 Mb for one package\r\n5. Multiple entries not share they memory cache (at least that what it's looks like when i try that) and even result to build hang.\r\n\r\nSo this solution looks pretty light and bring our build with webpack 5 to be at least not slower than with webpack 4, which, in turns, will allow us to move to webpack 5.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nFlag `cache.readonly` in config, which is disable cache store in store method of `PackFileCacheStrategy`\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nyes\r\n",

The webassembly binary is apart of an npm package that my project depends on.\r\n\r\nSometimes I want to build that webassembly library locally, and when I do, I `yarn link` the other package to my webpack project. I also build a debug version of the webassembly binary which is much bigger than the one that is used otherwise (hundreds of MBs).\r\n\r\nIn this linked mode, every time I rebuild the webassembly binary, it triggers the hot reloader, and fails with this trace:\r\n```\r\n<e> [webpack-dev-middleware] HookWebpackError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at makeWebpackError (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/HookWebpackError.js:48:9)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:3060:12\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:20:1)\r\n<e>     at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n<e> -- inner error --\r\n<e> TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at WeakMap.set (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at toCachedSource (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:70:18)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:148:28\r\n<e>     at fn (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:536:19)\r\n<e>     at _next8 (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:12:17)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:29:1)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:11:1)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/SourceMapDevToolPlugin.js:549:10\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2830:7\r\n<e>     at Object.each (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2857:9)\r\n<e> caused by plugins in Compilation.hooks.processAssets\r\n<e> TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at WeakMap.set (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at toCachedSource (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:70:18)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:148:28\r\n<e>     at fn (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:536:19)\r\n<e>     at _next8 (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:12:17)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:29:1)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:11:1)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/SourceMapDevToolPlugin.js:549:10\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2830:7\r\n<e>     at Object.each (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2857:9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I kill the dev server and restart it, all is fine.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI don't have a good way to reproduce this just yet.

Since we had nesting of components as well, we were ending up duplicating the code. \r\n\r\nHence we used the optimization block inside the config.\r\n```\r\noptimization: {\r\n    splitChunks: {\r\n      chunks: 'all',\r\n      minChunks: 1,\r\n      minSize: 1000,\r\n      maxInitialRequests: Infinity,\r\n      cacheGroups: {\r\n        vendorCss: {\r\n          test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](@hotstar\\/isomorphic-style-loader|css-loader)[\\\\/]/,\r\n          name: 'vendor_css_loaders',\r\n          chunks: 'all',\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut after using this to bundle our components lib, and using this library inside the next.js app we get the error\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property '__esModule' of undefined\r\n    at /Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/node_modules/@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src/index.js:328:34\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/node_modules/@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src/index.js:330:12)\r\n    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1085:14)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1114:10)\r\n    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:950:32)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:790:12)\r\n    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:974:19)\r\n    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:93:18)\r\n    at Object.@hotstar/web-ui-components-lib/modern/components/Molecule/CustomError/src (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/packages/website/.next/server/pages/_app.js:1273:18)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (/Users/ajayjaggi/Desktop/Hotstar/web-website/packages/website/.next/server/webpack-runtime.js:33:42)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich arises from here at 192 line.\r\n![Screenshot 2022-08-04 at 12 34 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85304785/182784693-1eb46b9f-6478-47e2-aeaa-b3ec4682eff6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n Mentioned above\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should run without giving any errors\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.40\r\nNode.js version:  14.0.0\r\nOperating System: mac os\r\nnext.js version: 12.0.7\r\n\r\n",

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Source maps provide a reasonable debugging experience at runtime, but when analyzing an exception, it's difficult to reconstruct an unminified stack trace, even with V3 source maps available. The best case of this often is that the token at the point of the error can be discovered, so a language parser will need to walk backward from that token to try to find a function declaration to get the name.\r\n\r\nConsider a tiny example such as this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction causeError() {\r\n  throw new Error('Expected failure.');\r\n}\r\ncauseError();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon minification, this might become:\r\n```js\r\n(()=>{throw new Error('Expected failure.')})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA plain rendering of this in an error stack might look like:\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at example.js:1:13\r\n    at example.js:1:45\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith source maps, we can get a pretty reasonable output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at example-src.js:2:3\r\n    at example-src.js:4:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the token at 2:3 is `throw`. That isn't terribly useful. If I reconstructed that stack by hand, I would expect:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Expected failure.\r\n    at causeError (example-src.js:2:3)\r\n    at Global code (example-src.js:4:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo that end, the Edge DevTools team are proposing a v4 of Source Maps that will support this by encoding a notion of \"scopes\" -- source text ranges that correspond to a given runtime name. This is at MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers#538.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nWe've seen other tools that do this -- https://github.com/bloomberg/pasta-sourcemaps as an example -- but if we can standardize this, we can incorporate that functionality into our everyday developer tools.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nThe spec proposes that the `scopes` field would be comprised of a list 6 VLQs for each scope name mapping:\r\n - Source index\r\n - Start line\r\n - Start column\r\n - End line\r\n - End column\r\n - Scope name index\r\n\r\nGiven an input source map from a tool like TypeScript already producing these values, the only thing a tool like Webpack would need to do is combine all of them, in this case, combining and de-duping the `scopeNames` field, and providing a small amount of modification (updating the source index and scope name index) when combining all of the various `scopes` values from each of the input source maps.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nYes. And, I've been working on producing this in TypeScript as well -- microsoft/typescript#47152\r\n",

After my investigation it's caused by different `moduleIds`.\r\nI take an experiment to prove it. \r\nFirst, I saved my project in two version while their `monaco-editor` versions are identity. When I used the `moduleIds: 'named'` and built my  project in prod env. They got the same content hash. \r\nBut when I changed the `modulesIds` to an Id type, e.g. 'deterministic', 'size'. They got different hash values. \r\nI did not have idea for why it happened since it was hard to read in prod env. But I think it was caused by importing different modules.\r\nHowever, the dependencies's content are identity. So I expect the content hash will be identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nHash content should not be disturbed by `moduleIds`.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nTo avoid the content hash being disturbed by moduleIds\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nHash content before moduleIds optimization will avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nno\r\n",

This way, users that are in the middle of a git rebase or want to pause compilation by any means, can do that. In addition, it would be nice to have a interactive terminal where you can specify watch mode, what files to compile and such.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a functional interactive CLI first, look at how [`jest watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#running-from-the-command-line) is doing this.\r\n\r\n![skjermbilde 2018-09-15 kl 10 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16735925/45584235-58f59d00-b8d0-11e8-887b-38b7a18e4316.png)\r\n \r\nThe features that should be available would be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 m: filter modules\r\n\u2022 p: pause watching (i. e. when doing git actions)\r\n\u2022 r: reload configuration and restart webpack\r\n\u2022 c: clear cache and recompile\r\n\u2022 e: explore mode to interactively walk the module/chunk graph to find out why a module is included\r\n\u2022 w: select a module and print out why it's included\r\n\u2022 q: quit\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis PR should go against the branch #527 is pointed towards. Feel free to reach out to any of the CLI members to get assistance in implementing this!\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do, is to implement the logic for the command, which should be done as a method [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/refactor-bin-folder/lib/commands/internal.js#L1)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking! \ud83d\udc99 ",

                "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs apart of the new CLI, one thing that would be nice to have is a `webpack interactive` command. This way, users that are in the middle of a git rebase or want to pause compilation by any means, can do that. In addition, it would be nice to have a interactive terminal where you can specify watch mode, what files to compile and such.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a functional interactive CLI first, look at how [`jest watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#running-from-the-command-line) is doing this.\r\n\r\n![skjermbilde 2018-09-15 kl 10 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16735925/45584235-58f59d00-b8d0-11e8-887b-38b7a18e4316.png)\r\n \r\nThe features that should be available would be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 m: filter modules\r\n\u2022 p: pause watching (i. e. when doing git actions)\r\n\u2022 r: reload configuration and restart webpack\r\n\u2022 c: clear cache and recompile\r\n\u2022 e: explore mode to interactively walk the module/chunk graph to find out why a module is included\r\n\u2022 w: select a module and print out why it's included\r\n\u2022 q: quit\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis PR should go against the branch #527 is pointed towards. Feel free to reach out to any of the CLI members to get assistance in implementing this!\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do, is to implement the logic for the command, which should be done as a method [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/refactor-bin-folder/lib/commands/internal.js#L1)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking! \ud83d\udc99 ",

It happens when both bundles use the same third party library, but each one imports a different code from that library. The actual result is that the main bundle includes both of the imported codes from the third party library.\r\n\r\nFor example, using React: \r\n\r\nThis is the entry point of webpack: index.js\r\n```\r\nimport { Component1 } from 'third-party-components-library';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport loadable from '@loadable/component';\r\n\r\nexport const MainComponent = () => {\r\n  const LoadableComponent = loadable(() => import('./LoadableComponent'));\r\n  return (\r\n    <Component1>\r\n      <LoadableComponent />\r\n    </Component1>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis is the loadable component: LoadableComponent.js \r\n```\r\nimport { Component2 } from 'third-party-components-library';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst LoadableComponent = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Component2/>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport default LoadableComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo separated bundles are created:  First for index.js, which is the webpack entry point,  and the second for LoadableComponent.js. The first one includes both codes for Component1 and Component2 from \u2018third-party-components-library\u2019. The second one doesn\u2019t include any code from \u2018third-party-components-library\u2019. \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nUse the loadable-components library via its webpack plugin:\r\nhttps://loadable-components.com/docs/getting-started/\r\nhttps://loadable-components.com/docs/api-loadable-webpack-plugin/\r\nThe main bundle, which is the bundle that is created from the webpack entrypoint, should import a component from a third party library. The main bundle should include a loadable-component. The loadable-component should import a different component from the same third party library.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected behavior is that webpack will split the code between the main bundle and the loadable bundle in a way that each bundle includes only the relevant code from the third party library.\r\nIn the context of the previous example:\r\nThe main bundle (for index.js entry point) should include only the code for Component1 from 'third-party-components-library' and the second bundle (for LoadableComponent.js) should include only the code for Component2 from 'third-party-components-library'.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.0.0\r\nNode.js version: 12.18.0\r\nOperating System: \r\nAdditional tools:",

After profiling the code, I've found that `createHash` was adding most of the time to the processing.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it in synthetic tests. My current assumption is that high memory pressure and GC are involved. I can investigate it later but would like the fix to be checked in.\r\n\r\nWe use `webpack-subresource-integrity` plugin, half of the hashes come form it and are recalculated through the hook. Since `hash` is only needed when there wasn't one generated by an external plugin, it's safe to move its creation into the same conditional block, where it's used. \r\n\r\nThis minor change improved `RealContentHashPlugin` processing time by **5x**:\r\n\r\n_Note: timing is provided by `ProfilingPlugin`_\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n_OS:_ Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n_CPU:_ Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL @ 2.60Ghz\r\n_MEM:_ 64GB\r\n_Node.js:_ 14.20.0\r\n_Hashing Algorithm:_ `xxhash64`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 34% (559s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 31% (741s)`\r\nRun 3: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 33% (587s)`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (93s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (95s)`\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\nRefactoring.

After profiling the code, I've found that `createHash` was adding most of the time to the processing.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce it in synthetic tests. My current assumption is that high memory pressure and GC are involved. I can investigate it later but would like the fix to be checked in.\r\n\r\nWe use `webpack-subresource-integrity` plugin, half of the hashes come form it and are recalculated through the hook. Since `hash` is only needed when there wasn't one generated by an external plugin, it's safe to move its creation into the same conditional block, where it's used. \r\n\r\nThis minor change improved `RealContentHashPlugin` processing time by **5x**:\r\n\r\n_Note: timing is provided by `ProfilingPlugin`_\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n_OS:_ Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n_CPU:_ Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL @ 2.60Ghz\r\n_MEM:_ 64GB\r\n_Node.js:_ 14.20.0\r\n_Hashing Algorithm:_ `xxhash64`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 34% (559s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 31% (741s)`\r\nRun 3: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 33% (587s)`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nRun 1: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (93s)`\r\nRun 2: `RealContentHashPlugin(sealing) - 7% (95s)`\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\nRefactoring.

Feel free to close this issue if there is no action to be had but our main bundle went from taking 38ms to execute all the way to 97ms. On mobile iOS, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nI dug through the release notes and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause but I may try to update this ticket if I can find the culprit.\r\n\r\nA few comments about our webpack config\r\n- We have multi config system (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-multiple-configurations)\r\n- We are using babel with typescript, sass, and general assets types\r\n- This is what we have set for our optimization field\r\n\r\n```\r\n    optimization: {\r\n        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false }), new CssMinimizerPlugin()]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n- No source maps are sent with our production build\r\n- There was no discernible difference in our bundle module sizes when using a bundle analyzer\r\n\r\nI'll update this ticket if I find anything else\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 22 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287704-bfbea41f-3d86-4282-9ac2-4e12d9d2657f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"429\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-31 at 4 29 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751354/171287711-dabae87a-6f06-4196-bf7e-5ecd6a815dce.png\">\r\n\r\n",

It would be great to continue using npm to manage dependencies but to have the option to output the dependencies into a directory tree that can be accessed by web server and loaded directly by the browser, on a per file on demand basis. \r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nPerhaps just a configuration switch like static_file_tree=true or browser_direct_es6_static_dir=on\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nIt seems this kind of thing would require wizard level.\r\n\r\n",

With some typical config, I succeed in the code-splitting in a \"_multi JS + single CSS_\" style. \r\n\r\nHowever, although the `mini-css-extract-plugin` only generates a single CSS file, the generated entry ESM is still trying to import the JS file with the same chunk name. This will cause runtime error in browsers. The ESM will fail to initialize due to the following error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    :8080/styles.js:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11671, the key difference in this issue is `outputModule: true` I think. I've done some debugging on my own but no lock, any guidance will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nPlease checkout https://github.com/evisong/testcase-webpack-esm-css-extract,\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\n```log\r\n$ webpack serve --mode development --no-hot\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv4): http://172.24.49.91:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv6): http://[fe80::1]:8080/\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from 'public, dist' directory\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-middleware] wait until bundle finished: /\r\nasset vendors-node_modules_webpack-dev-server_client_index_js_protocol_ws_3A_hostname_0_0_0_0_port_-262e74.js 193 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (id hint: vendors)\r\nasset runtime.js 4.93 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: runtime)\r\nasset esm.js 4.36 KiB [emitted] [javascript module] (name: esm)\r\nasset styles.css 493 bytes [emitted] (name: styles) (id hint: styles)\r\nEntrypoint esm 203 KiB = runtime.js 4.93 KiB styles.css 493 bytes vendors-node_modules_webpack-dev-server_client_index_js_protocol_ws_3A_hostname_0_0_0_0_port_-262e74.js 193 KiB esm.js 4.36 KiB\r\nruntime modules 3.73 KiB 15 modules\r\norphan modules 3.23 KiB [orphan] 4 modules\r\njavascript modules 154 KiB\r\n  modules by path ./node_modules/ 154 KiB 20 modules\r\n  modules by path ./src/ 437 bytes\r\n    modules by path ./src/*.js 337 bytes 3 modules\r\n    modules by path ./src/*.css 100 bytes\r\n      ./src/app-a.css 50 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n      ./src/app-b.css 50 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\ncss modules 67 bytes\r\n  css ./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/app-a.css 33 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n  css ./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/app-b.css 34 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\nwebpack 5.72.0 compiled successfully in 514 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nVisit http://localhost:8080/ in browser, the DevTools -> Console shows an error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    :8080/styles.js:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nDouble-check in DevTools -> Network, the resource is missing:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nRequest URL: http://localhost:8080/styles.js\r\nRequest Method: GET\r\nStatus Code: 404 Not Found\r\nRemote Address: [::1]:8080\r\nReferrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut its reference appears at the bottom the `http://localhost:8080/esm.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ...\r\nimport * as __webpack_chunk_0__ from \"./styles.js\";\r\n__webpack_require__.C(__webpack_chunk_0__);\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe entry ESM bundle `http://localhost:8080/esm.js` should not import anything from the nonexisting `styles.js`.\r\n\r\nAccording to a quick debug, in [webpack/lib/esm/ModuleChunkFormatPlugin.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/d3a0f8de03f26a83b4d5db3cfe177617a3801df3/lib/esm/ModuleChunkFormatPlugin.js#L144-L161), the `import` code for `styles` chunk (containing both `javascript` and `css/mini-extract` modules) is rendered just like the other chunks.

Project is monorepo with several (or more) packages where every one of them is compiled to single js file. Packages are quite big (result file is about 1-2 Mb). node_modules are hoisted to root and can be effectivly cached between all packages.\r\n2. Build is almost always production and not in watch mode.\r\n3. We need to somehow reduce compilation time of all packages. Especially in CI.\r\n4. Separate cache for every package is not efficient in terms of time: in CI it's not helping and memory: we have server and client builds and cache for them is about 100 Mb for one package\r\n5. Multiple entries not share they memory cache (at least that what it's looks like when i try that) and even result to build hang.\r\n\r\nSo this solution looks pretty light and bring our build with webpack 5 to be at least not slower than with webpack 4, which, in turns, will allow us to move to webpack 5.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nFlag `cache.readonly` in config, which is disable cache store in store method of `PackFileCacheStrategy`\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nyes\r\n",

The webassembly binary is apart of an npm package that my project depends on.\r\n\r\nSometimes I want to build that webassembly library locally, and when I do, I `yarn link` the other package to my webpack project. I also build a debug version of the webassembly binary which is much bigger than the one that is used otherwise (hundreds of MBs).\r\n\r\nIn this linked mode, every time I rebuild the webassembly binary, it triggers the hot reloader, and fails with this trace:\r\n```\r\n<e> [webpack-dev-middleware] HookWebpackError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at makeWebpackError (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/HookWebpackError.js:48:9)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:3060:12\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:20:1)\r\n<e>     at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n<e> -- inner error --\r\n<e> TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at WeakMap.set (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at toCachedSource (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:70:18)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:148:28\r\n<e>     at fn (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:536:19)\r\n<e>     at _next8 (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:12:17)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:29:1)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:11:1)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/SourceMapDevToolPlugin.js:549:10\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2830:7\r\n<e>     at Object.each (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2857:9)\r\n<e> caused by plugins in Compilation.hooks.processAssets\r\n<e> TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\r\n<e>     at WeakMap.set (<anonymous>)\r\n<e>     at toCachedSource (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:70:18)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js:148:28\r\n<e>     at fn (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:536:19)\r\n<e>     at _next8 (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:12:17)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:29:1)\r\n<e>     at eval (eval at create (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/tapable/lib/HookCodeFactory.js:33:10), <anonymous>:11:1)\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/webpack/lib/SourceMapDevToolPlugin.js:549:10\r\n<e>     at <home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2830:7\r\n<e>     at Object.each (<home_directory>/my_webpack_project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2857:9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I kill the dev server and restart it, all is fine.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI don't have a good way to reproduce this just yet.
