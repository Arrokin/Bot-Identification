But, in the case of an underlying `JSONDecodingError.missingValue` error, the error description doesn't provide enough information to understand what the problem actually was. You know that there was an object and a value was missing, but no idea what key wasn't found.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to start a discussion on how to improve this. By adding `fieldInfo` to `GraphQLExecutionError` it's possible to print out `fieldInfo.cacheKeyForField` and figure out what the key was.\r\n\r\nI ended up taking this approach because it was the least invasive. No current consumer of `GraphQLExecutionError` has to change anything, and all the tests continue to pass. I considered adding an associated value to `JSONDecodingError.missingValue` but that would have been a much larger change. Also, there are already situations where the `FieldExecutionInfo` wouldn't make sense for `JSONDecodingError`. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy to change any/all of this. Like I said, I just want to start a process of improving this.",

I managed to make every test in `apollo-server-integrations-testsuite` pass except for one, `throws an error if POST JSON is malformed`. This test checks the error message in the server response when malformed JSON data is sent and matches it to two possible substrings, `Unexpected token f` and `Bad Request`.\r\n\r\nNext.js's `apiResolver` uses the [parseBody](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/api-utils/node.ts#L143) function to parse the request body, which in turn uses [parseJSON](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/api-utils/node.ts#L126) to parse JSON. In the case of malformed JSON `parseJSON` throws an `ApiError` with the message `Invalid JSON`, which is then returned in the server response. Since it's not possible for me to change the message returned by Next.js I was hoping I could add it to the tests's allowed error messages, making the test pass.\r\n",

This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.

Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/rover/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Open source\r\ncontribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much\r\nas possible. Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context\r\nthat can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage\r\ndiscussion first. Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to\r\nmerge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to\r\navoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI was trying to build rover in nixpkgs, where we prefetch the schema and hash.id since otherwise the build would fail. I noticed though even though the file existed it would still try and download it, and would fail as expected. \r\n\r\nIt seems to be `||` is the wrong operator here - if the file exists already, it'll check if you're online.

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

We suggest you read it!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* \u23f0 Your time is important\r\n        To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will\r\n        take more than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an\r\n        issue first. This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

This will allow better handling of this specific error condition for observers of `didEncounterErrors` events. \r\n\r\nI intend to use this to suppress logging of these errors when someone attempts to point a studio sandbox at my production servers and leaves schema auto-update on. :|\r\n\r\nTo make this work with the existing code, it is now possible to set any custom GraphQLError.extensions.code when calling `ValidationContext.reportError()`. Someone can now wire through their own validation error codes and see them on the `didEncounterErrors` events instead of them all being masked as GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED (which is really the root reason for this PR). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for feedback if you want to use the suspect typescript cast in the `ValidationError` constructor:\r\n```ts\r\n (graphqlError.extensions?.code as ApolloServerErrorCode) \r\n```\r\nor change the `GraphQLErrorWithCode` constructor signature to use:\r\n```ts\r\ncode: ApolloServerErrorCode | unknown,\r\n```\r\n\r\n ",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHello there. Today, I looked for ApolloServer API document and found a broken link.\r\n\r\nI searched why this link is broken and then recognized that the word `implementing services` was replaced with `subgraphs` before.\r\n\r\nSo I make this commit for fix broken links. Actually I'm not sure which of new document is proper one, so I just linked with subgraph entry pages. (without URL hash)\r\n\r\nI'm so excited to contribute this project!",

It also updates existing `ansi_term` usage to route through this utility.\r\n\r\nI didn't write any tests or docs for this change, mostly because I didn't any existing precedent for similar behavior. I'm happy to add either tests or docs, just let me know the general pattern you'd like to see.\r\n",

A From impl is infeasible as they are defined in different crates but a function could be nice, or an ext trait to add `.source_span()` to SyntaxNodes \ud83d\ude04 ",

This PR seeks to unify the names of the other two on* methods with `onError` to feel cohesive. This PR deprecates the `onSubscriptionData` and `onSubscriptionComplete` functions with a warning. Passing both `onSubscriptionData` and `onData` or `onSubscriptionComplete` and `onComplete` will also result in a warning explaining that only one of them will be used.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] If this PR is a new feature, please reference an issue where a consensus about the design was reached (not necessary for small changes)\r\n- [x] Make sure all of the significant new logic is covered by tests\r\n",

As it stands, there is no mention of our use of git submodules in the guide, and running through the process as described fails at the container build stage due to missing files/context. While a little investigative work makes the reason for the above occurrence  clear, including this information up front makes for a better development experience. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFirst, \ud83c\udf20 thank you \ud83c\udf20 for considering a contribution to Apollo!\r\n\r\nSome of this information is also included in the /CONTRIBUTING.md file at the\r\nroot of this repository.  We suggest you read it!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* \u23f0 Your time is important\r\n        To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will\r\n        take more than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an\r\n        issue first. This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

We suggest you read it!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* \u23f0 Your time is important\r\n        To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will\r\n        take more than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an\r\n        issue first. This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\n- Use an absolute path for Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nI'm running up `apollographql/router` by Docker Compose for my local development. And, I'm changing the working directory for the `router` image like below in order to mount my application repository:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nversion: \"3.8\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  router:\r\n    image: ghcr.io/apollographql/router:v1.0.0-alpha.0\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - .:/workspace:cached\r\n    working_dir: /workspace\r\n    command: --config router.yaml --supergraph schema.graphql\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the current Dockerfile specifies a relative path (`./router`) for `ENTRYPOINT`, changing the working directory causes an error \r\n\r\n```\r\nError response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"./router\": stat ./router: no such file or directory: unknown\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I created this PR that changes `ENTRYPOINT` from a relative `./router` to an absolute `/dist/router`.",

This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by case.",

But, in the case of an underlying `JSONDecodingError.missingValue` error, the error description doesn't provide enough information to understand what the problem actually was. You know that there was an object and a value was missing, but no idea what key wasn't found.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to start a discussion on how to improve this. By adding `fieldInfo` to `GraphQLExecutionError` it's possible to print out `fieldInfo.cacheKeyForField` and figure out what the key was.\r\n\r\nI ended up taking this approach because it was the least invasive. No current consumer of `GraphQLExecutionError` has to change anything, and all the tests continue to pass. I considered adding an associated value to `JSONDecodingError.missingValue` but that would have been a much larger change. Also, there are already situations where the `FieldExecutionInfo` wouldn't make sense for `JSONDecodingError`. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy to change any/all of this. Like I said, I just want to start a process of improving this.",

When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.

I managed to make every test in `apollo-server-integrations-testsuite` pass except for one, `throws an error if POST JSON is malformed`. This test checks the error message in the server response when malformed JSON data is sent and matches it to two possible substrings, `Unexpected token f` and `Bad Request`.\r\n\r\nNext.js's `apiResolver` uses the [parseBody](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/api-utils/node.ts#L143) function to parse the request body, which in turn uses [parseJSON](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/api-utils/node.ts#L126) to parse JSON. In the case of malformed JSON `parseJSON` throws an `ApiError` with the message `Invalid JSON`, which is then returned in the server response. Since it's not possible for me to change the message returned by Next.js I was hoping I could add it to the tests's allowed error messages, making the test pass.\r\n",

We suggest you read it!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* \u23f0 Your time is important\r\n        To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will\r\n        take more than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an\r\n        issue first. This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/rover/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.

Open source\r\ncontribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much\r\nas possible. Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context\r\nthat can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage\r\ndiscussion first. Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to\r\nmerge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to\r\navoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI was trying to build rover in nixpkgs, where we prefetch the schema and hash.id since otherwise the build would fail. I noticed though even though the file existed it would still try and download it, and would fail as expected. \r\n\r\nIt seems to be `||` is the wrong operator here - if the file exists already, it'll check if you're online.

When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

This will allow better handling of this specific error condition for observers of `didEncounterErrors` events. \r\n\r\nI intend to use this to suppress logging of these errors when someone attempts to point a studio sandbox at my production servers and leaves schema auto-update on. :|\r\n\r\nTo make this work with the existing code, it is now possible to set any custom GraphQLError.extensions.code when calling `ValidationContext.reportError()`. Someone can now wire through their own validation error codes and see them on the `didEncounterErrors` events instead of them all being masked as GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED (which is really the root reason for this PR). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for feedback if you want to use the suspect typescript cast in the `ValidationError` constructor:\r\n```ts\r\n (graphqlError.extensions?.code as ApolloServerErrorCode) \r\n```\r\nor change the `GraphQLErrorWithCode` constructor signature to use:\r\n```ts\r\ncode: ApolloServerErrorCode | unknown,\r\n```\r\n\r\n ",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHello there. Today, I looked for ApolloServer API document and found a broken link.\r\n\r\nI searched why this link is broken and then recognized that the word `implementing services` was replaced with `subgraphs` before.\r\n\r\nSo I make this commit for fix broken links. Actually I'm not sure which of new document is proper one, so I just linked with subgraph entry pages. (without URL hash)\r\n\r\nI'm so excited to contribute this project!",

It also updates existing `ansi_term` usage to route through this utility.\r\n\r\nI didn't write any tests or docs for this change, mostly because I didn't any existing precedent for similar behavior. I'm happy to add either tests or docs, just let me know the general pattern you'd like to see.\r\n",

A From impl is infeasible as they are defined in different crates but a function could be nice, or an ext trait to add `.source_span()` to SyntaxNodes \ud83d\ude04 ",

As it stands, there is no mention of our use of git submodules in the guide, and running through the process as described fails at the container build stage due to missing files/context. While a little investigative work makes the reason for the above occurrence  clear, including this information up front makes for a better development experience. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFirst, \ud83c\udf20 thank you \ud83c\udf20 for considering a contribution to Apollo!\r\n\r\nSome of this information is also included in the /CONTRIBUTING.md file at the\r\nroot of this repository.

This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

And, I'm changing the working directory for the `router` image like below in order to mount my application repository:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nversion: \"3.8\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  router:\r\n    image: ghcr.io/apollographql/router:v1.0.0-alpha.0\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - .:/workspace:cached\r\n    working_dir: /workspace\r\n    command: --config router.yaml --supergraph schema.graphql\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the current Dockerfile specifies a relative path (`./router`) for `ENTRYPOINT`, changing the working directory causes an error \r\n\r\n```\r\nError response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"./router\": stat ./router: no such file or directory: unknown\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I created this PR that changes `ENTRYPOINT` from a relative `./router` to an absolute `/dist/router`.",

This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by case.",

This is then passed to the `fetch` call. This allows for finer control of the `fetch`, such as attaching an `AbortController` so the it can be cancelled.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for this same option to match this behavior.

But, in the case of an underlying `JSONDecodingError.missingValue` error, the error description doesn't provide enough information to understand what the problem actually was. You know that there was an object and a value was missing, but no idea what key wasn't found.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to start a discussion on how to improve this. By adding `fieldInfo` to `GraphQLExecutionError` it's possible to print out `fieldInfo.cacheKeyForField` and figure out what the key was.\r\n\r\nI ended up taking this approach because it was the least invasive. No current consumer of `GraphQLExecutionError` has to change anything, and all the tests continue to pass. I considered adding an associated value to `JSONDecodingError.missingValue` but that would have been a much larger change. Also, there are already situations where the `FieldExecutionInfo` wouldn't make sense for `JSONDecodingError`. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy to change any/all of this. Like I said, I just want to start a process of improving this.",

This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* Federation versions\r\n        Please make sure you're targeting the federation version you're opening the PR for.  Federation 2 (alpha) is currently located on the `main` branch and prior versions of Federation live on the `version-0.x` branch.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Open source\r\ncontribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much\r\nas possible. Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context\r\nthat can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage\r\ndiscussion first. Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to\r\nmerge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to\r\navoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

I managed to make every test in `apollo-server-integrations-testsuite` pass except for one, `throws an error if POST JSON is malformed`. This test checks the error message in the server response when malformed JSON data is sent and matches it to two possible substrings, `Unexpected token f` and `Bad Request`.\r\n\r\nNext.js's `apiResolver` uses the [parseBody](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/api-utils/node.ts#L143) function to parse the request body, which in turn uses [parseJSON](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/api-utils/node.ts#L126) to parse JSON. In the case of malformed JSON `parseJSON` throws an `ApiError` with the message `Invalid JSON`, which is then returned in the server response. Since it's not possible for me to change the message returned by Next.js I was hoping I could add it to the tests's allowed error messages, making the test pass.\r\n",

If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.

Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.

Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

This will allow better handling of this specific error condition for observers of `didEncounterErrors` events. \r\n\r\nI intend to use this to suppress logging of these errors when someone attempts to point a studio sandbox at my production servers and leaves schema auto-update on. :|\r\n\r\nTo make this work with the existing code, it is now possible to set any custom GraphQLError.extensions.code when calling `ValidationContext.reportError()`. Someone can now wire through their own validation error codes and see them on the `didEncounterErrors` events instead of them all being masked as GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED (which is really the root reason for this PR). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for feedback if you want to use the suspect typescript cast in the `ValidationError` constructor:\r\n```ts\r\n (graphqlError.extensions?.code as ApolloServerErrorCode) \r\n```\r\nor change the `GraphQLErrorWithCode` constructor signature to use:\r\n```ts\r\ncode: ApolloServerErrorCode | unknown,\r\n```\r\n\r\n ",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHello there. Today, I looked for ApolloServer API document and found a broken link.\r\n\r\nI searched why this link is broken and then recognized that the word `implementing services` was replaced with `subgraphs` before.\r\n\r\nSo I make this commit for fix broken links. Actually I'm not sure which of new document is proper one, so I just linked with subgraph entry pages. (without URL hash)\r\n\r\nI'm so excited to contribute this project!",

It also updates existing `ansi_term` usage to route through this utility.\r\n\r\nI didn't write any tests or docs for this change, mostly because I didn't any existing precedent for similar behavior.

A From impl is infeasible as they are defined in different crates but a function could be nice, or an ext trait to add `.source_span()` to SyntaxNodes \ud83d\ude04 ",

This PR seeks to unify the names of the other two on* methods with `onError` to feel cohesive. This PR deprecates the `onSubscriptionData` and `onSubscriptionComplete` functions with a warning. Passing both `onSubscriptionData` and `onData` or `onSubscriptionComplete` and `onComplete` will also result in a warning explaining that only one of them will be used.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] If this PR is a new feature, please reference an issue where a consensus about the design was reached (not necessary for small changes)\r\n- [x] Make sure all of the significant new logic is covered by tests\r\n",

As it stands, there is no mention of our use of git submodules in the guide, and running through the process as described fails at the container build stage due to missing files/context. While a little investigative work makes the reason for the above occurrence  clear, including this information up front makes for a better development experience. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFirst, \ud83c\udf20 thank you \ud83c\udf20 for considering a contribution to Apollo!\r\n\r\nSome of this information is also included in the /CONTRIBUTING.md file at the\r\nroot of this repository.  We suggest you read it!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* \u23f0 Your time is important\r\n        To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will\r\n        take more than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an\r\n        issue first. This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

Be\r\n          sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!) prior to\r\n          opening a new request.  If an existing issue covers the need, please upvote\r\n          that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a new issue.\r\n* \ud83d\udd0c Integrations\r\n          Apollo Server has many web-framework integrations including Express, Koa,\r\n          Hapi and more.  When adding a new feature, or fixing a bug, please take a\r\n          peak and see if other integrations are also affected.  In most cases, the\r\n          fix can be applied to the other frameworks as well.  Please note that,\r\n          since new web-frameworks have a high maintenance cost, pull-requests for\r\n          new web-frameworks should be discussed with a project maintainer first.\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n          Follow https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n          tests for all new behavior.\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your\r\n          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to associated issues!\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n-->\r\n",

We suggest you read it!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nHere are some important details to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* \u23f0 Your time is important\r\n        To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will\r\n        take more than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an\r\n        issue first. This is especially true for feature requests!\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udca1 Features\r\n        Feature requests can be created and discussed within a GitHub Issue.\r\n        Be sure to search for existing feature requests (and related issues!)\r\n        prior to opening a new request. If an existing issue covers the need,\r\n        please upvote that issue by using the \ud83d\udc4d emote, rather than opening a\r\n        new issue.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd77 Bug fixes\r\n        These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,\r\n        please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should\r\n        still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udcd6 Contribution guidelines\r\n        Follow https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n        when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add\r\n        tests for all new behavior.\r\n\r\n* \u270f\ufe0f Explain your pull request\r\n        Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what\r\n        your pull request is meant to accomplish. Provide \ud83d\udd17 links \ud83d\udd17 to\r\n        associated issues!  Documentation in the docs/ directory should be updated\r\n        as necessary.  Finally, a /CHANGELOG.md entry should be added.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will find this to be a positive experience! Contribution can be\r\nintimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible. Without\r\nfollowing these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed\r\nwith your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by\r\nfollowing these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\n- Use an absolute path for Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nI'm running up `apollographql/router` by Docker Compose for my local development. And, I'm changing the working directory for the `router` image like below in order to mount my application repository:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nversion: \"3.8\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  router:\r\n    image: ghcr.io/apollographql/router:v1.0.0-alpha.0\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - .:/workspace:cached\r\n    working_dir: /workspace\r\n    command: --config router.yaml --supergraph schema.graphql\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the current Dockerfile specifies a relative path (`./router`) for `ENTRYPOINT`, changing the working directory causes an error \r\n\r\n```\r\nError response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"./router\": stat ./router: no such file or directory: unknown\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I created this PR that changes `ENTRYPOINT` from a relative `./router` to an absolute `/dist/router`.",

This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by case.",
