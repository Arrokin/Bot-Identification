I'm not opening new issue because I think it can be somehow related with this one \ud83d\ude42 \n\nSo, after updating to 8.3.1 this issue appeared:\n![Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 00 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106966230/194036711-c4b3b6fb-c0bc-4b0c-b3d9-951cf83767bf.png)\n\n`mode` and `selectedDate` comes from props. Their types are defined as follows:\n```\nmode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';\nselectedDate: DatesType\n```\n(and `DatesType: Date | Date[] | DateRange | undefined`, where `DateRange` is imported from `react-day-picker)\n\nAt this point I ran out of ideas how to resolve this issue. The only solution that worked, was something like this:\n```\n{ mode === 'single' && <DayPicker mode='single' selected={selectedDate as Date | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'multiple' && <DayPicker mode='multiple' selected={selectedDate as Date[] | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'range' && <DayPicker mode='range' selected={selectedDate as DateRange | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n```\nbut to be hones it doesn't look too clean.\n\nMaybe you would know what is the issue here and if there is a better way to resolve it than the one I showed above?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude03\n\n_Originally posted by @bartlomiej-bykowy in https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1570#discussioncomment-3803763_\n    ",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

It seems to occur in \"range\" mode when showing multiple months and the day that will be initially focused is part of the selected range and present on one calendar and also on the other calendar as an outside day. Both the \"inside\" day and the outside day have tabIndex=\"0\" when inspected.\r\n\r\nMy initial thought is that outside days should not be considered focusable (or maybe at least have it be an option?), but perhaps I am missing a valid use case.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps this [line](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/51a2ef79293b5145b1c38346cf73e17e9c414f13/packages/react-day-picker/src/contexts/Focus/utils/getInitialFocusTarget.tsx#L22) should be checking for `!activeModifiers.outside` as well? I haven't tried it out myself though, so it's possible the issue is due to something else.\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n[Fork this CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-day-picker-8-vl4ry with the code to reproduce the issue.](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-daypicker-forked-ocolmy?file=/src/App.tsx)\r\n\r\n#### Steps\r\n\r\n1. Focus the date picker\r\n2. Press Tab until a day on the calendar is focused\r\n3. Keep pressing Tab and you will be stuck cycling back between the day being focused and the right arrow being focused. You can sometimes see focus indicator on the outside day flash before focus is shifted to the \"inside\" day.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the focus should continue on to the next tabbable element and that the button shown below the DayPicker can be focused.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22672008/192423154-d0ca4235-505c-4bac-a804-b0b1d797f3a6.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",

                "body": "@DanielJKelly Thanks for your investigation! I could review your PR and apply some changes:\r\n\r\n- disabled tabIndex for outside days\r\n- added an integration test for your use case\r\n\r\nI think we should fix this in [getInitialFocusTarget](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/f291749bdd68f5eef4956cea3c26d0586b176dbf/packages/react-day-picker/src/contexts/Focus/utils/getInitialFocusTarget.ts), but this function is not aware of the outside days yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something if we don't check \"displayed days\"?",

Instead, nothing is disabled. If you comment out the `before` line, it disables using the `after` property properly.

I'm not opening new issue because I think it can be somehow related with this one \ud83d\ude42 \n\nSo, after updating to 8.3.1 this issue appeared:\n![Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 00 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106966230/194036711-c4b3b6fb-c0bc-4b0c-b3d9-951cf83767bf.png)\n\n`mode` and `selectedDate` comes from props. Their types are defined as follows:\n```\nmode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';\nselectedDate: DatesType\n```\n(and `DatesType: Date | Date[] | DateRange | undefined`, where `DateRange` is imported from `react-day-picker)\n\nAt this point I ran out of ideas how to resolve this issue. The only solution that worked, was something like this:\n```\n{ mode === 'single' && <DayPicker mode='single' selected={selectedDate as Date | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'multiple' && <DayPicker mode='multiple' selected={selectedDate as Date[] | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'range' && <DayPicker mode='range' selected={selectedDate as DateRange | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n```\nbut to be hones it doesn't look too clean.\n\nMaybe you would know what is the issue here and if there is a better way to resolve it than the one I showed above?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude03\n\n_Originally posted by @bartlomiej-bykowy in https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1570#discussioncomment-3803763_\n    ",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

It seems to occur in \"range\" mode when showing multiple months and the day that will be initially focused is part of the selected range and present on one calendar and also on the other calendar as an outside day. Both the \"inside\" day and the outside day have tabIndex=\"0\" when inspected.\r\n\r\nMy initial thought is that outside days should not be considered focusable (or maybe at least have it be an option?), but perhaps I am missing a valid use case.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps this [line](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/51a2ef79293b5145b1c38346cf73e17e9c414f13/packages/react-day-picker/src/contexts/Focus/utils/getInitialFocusTarget.tsx#L22) should be checking for `!activeModifiers.outside` as well? I haven't tried it out myself though, so it's possible the issue is due to something else.\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n[Fork this CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-day-picker-8-vl4ry with the code to reproduce the issue.](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-daypicker-forked-ocolmy?file=/src/App.tsx)\r\n\r\n#### Steps\r\n\r\n1. Focus the date picker\r\n2. Press Tab until a day on the calendar is focused\r\n3. Keep pressing Tab and you will be stuck cycling back between the day being focused and the right arrow being focused. You can sometimes see focus indicator on the outside day flash before focus is shifted to the \"inside\" day.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the focus should continue on to the next tabbable element and that the button shown below the DayPicker can be focused.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22672008/192423154-d0ca4235-505c-4bac-a804-b0b1d797f3a6.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",

I could review your PR and apply some changes:\r\n\r\n- disabled tabIndex for outside days\r\n- added an integration test for your use case\r\n\r\nI think we should fix this in [getInitialFocusTarget](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/f291749bdd68f5eef4956cea3c26d0586b176dbf/packages/react-day-picker/src/contexts/Focus/utils/getInitialFocusTarget.ts), but this function is not aware of the outside days yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something if we don't check \"displayed days\"?",

Instead, nothing is disabled. If you comment out the `before` line, it disables using the `after` property properly. And visa versa. \r\n\r\n```\r\n      <DayPicker\r\n        mode=\"day\"\r\n        selected={range}\r\n        onSelect={setRange}\r\n        disabled={{\r\n          before: new Date(new Date().getTime() - 10 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),\r\n          after: new Date()\r\n        }}\r\n        numberOfMonths={2}\r\n        weekStartsOn={1}\r\n        min={7}\r\n      />\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe correct days should be disabled\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 3 24 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10272829/192617348-cc6f013b-ae09-4b8b-bec3-12af717f47a7.png)\r\n",

Instead, nothing is disabled. If you comment out the `before` line, it disables using the `after` property properly. And visa versa. \r\n\r\n```\r\n      <DayPicker\r\n        mode=\"day\"\r\n        selected={range}\r\n        onSelect={setRange}\r\n        disabled={{\r\n          before: new Date(new Date().getTime() - 10 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),\r\n          after: new Date()\r\n        }}\r\n        numberOfMonths={2}\r\n        weekStartsOn={1}\r\n        min={7}\r\n      />\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe correct days should be disabled\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 3 24 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10272829/192617348-cc6f013b-ae09-4b8b-bec3-12af717f47a7.png)\r\n",

I'm not opening new issue because I think it can be somehow related with this one \ud83d\ude42 \n\nSo, after updating to 8.3.1 this issue appeared:\n![Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 00 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106966230/194036711-c4b3b6fb-c0bc-4b0c-b3d9-951cf83767bf.png)\n\n`mode` and `selectedDate` comes from props. Their types are defined as follows:\n```\nmode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';\nselectedDate: DatesType\n```\n(and `DatesType: Date | Date[] | DateRange | undefined`, where `DateRange` is imported from `react-day-picker)\n\nAt this point I ran out of ideas how to resolve this issue. The only solution that worked, was something like this:\n```\n{ mode === 'single' && <DayPicker mode='single' selected={selectedDate as Date | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'multiple' && <DayPicker mode='multiple' selected={selectedDate as Date[] | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'range' && <DayPicker mode='range' selected={selectedDate as DateRange | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n```\nbut to be hones it doesn't look too clean.\n\nMaybe you would know what is the issue here and if there is a better way to resolve it than the one I showed above?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude03\n\n_Originally posted by @bartlomiej-bykowy in https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1570#discussioncomment-3803763_\n    ",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

                "body": "### Bug description\r\n\r\nThis bug is related to focusing and outside days. It seems to occur in \"range\" mode when showing multiple months and the day that will be initially focused is part of the selected range and present on one calendar and also on the other calendar as an outside day. Both the \"inside\" day and the outside day have tabIndex=\"0\" when inspected.\r\n\r\nMy initial thought is that outside days should not be considered focusable (or maybe at least have it be an option?), but perhaps I am missing a valid use case.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps this [line](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/51a2ef79293b5145b1c38346cf73e17e9c414f13/packages/react-day-picker/src/contexts/Focus/utils/getInitialFocusTarget.tsx#L22) should be checking for `!activeModifiers.outside` as well? I haven't tried it out myself though, so it's possible the issue is due to something else.\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n[Fork this CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-day-picker-8-vl4ry with the code to reproduce the issue.](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-daypicker-forked-ocolmy?file=/src/App.tsx)\r\n\r\n#### Steps\r\n\r\n1. Focus the date picker\r\n2. Press Tab until a day on the calendar is focused\r\n3. Keep pressing Tab and you will be stuck cycling back between the day being focused and the right arrow being focused. You can sometimes see focus indicator on the outside day flash before focus is shifted to the \"inside\" day.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the focus should continue on to the next tabbable element and that the button shown below the DayPicker can be focused.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22672008/192423154-d0ca4235-505c-4bac-a804-b0b1d797f3a6.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",

I could review your PR and apply some changes:\r\n\r\n- disabled tabIndex for outside days\r\n- added an integration test for your use case\r\n\r\nI think we should fix this in [getInitialFocusTarget](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/f291749bdd68f5eef4956cea3c26d0586b176dbf/packages/react-day-picker/src/contexts/Focus/utils/getInitialFocusTarget.ts), but this function is not aware of the outside days yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something if we don't check \"displayed days\"?",

Instead, nothing is disabled. If you comment out the `before` line, it disables using the `after` property properly. And visa versa. \r\n\r\n```\r\n      <DayPicker\r\n        mode=\"day\"\r\n        selected={range}\r\n        onSelect={setRange}\r\n        disabled={{\r\n          before: new Date(new Date().getTime() - 10 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),\r\n          after: new Date()\r\n        }}\r\n        numberOfMonths={2}\r\n        weekStartsOn={1}\r\n        min={7}\r\n      />\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe correct days should be disabled\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 3 24 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10272829/192617348-cc6f013b-ae09-4b8b-bec3-12af717f47a7.png)\r\n",
