Open https://react-day-picker.js.org/start -Example\r\n2. Inspect today element(Button) observe the tabIndex is \"0\"\r\n3.  Navigate using Tab key focus moves from next(>) to today\r\n4. Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

                "body": "      Hi! I'm not opening new issue because I think it can be somehow related with this one \ud83d\ude42 \n\nSo, after updating to 8.3.1 this issue appeared:\n![Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 00 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106966230/194036711-c4b3b6fb-c0bc-4b0c-b3d9-951cf83767bf.png)\n\n`mode` and `selectedDate` comes from props. Their types are defined as follows:\n```\nmode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';\nselectedDate: DatesType\n```\n(and `DatesType: Date | Date[] | DateRange | undefined`, where `DateRange` is imported from `react-day-picker)\n\nAt this point I ran out of ideas how to resolve this issue. The only solution that worked, was something like this:\n```\n{ mode === 'single' && <DayPicker mode='single' selected={selectedDate as Date | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'multiple' && <DayPicker mode='multiple' selected={selectedDate as Date[] | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'range' && <DayPicker mode='range' selected={selectedDate as DateRange | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n```\nbut to be hones it doesn't look too clean.\n\nMaybe you would know what is the issue here and if there is a better way to resolve it than the one I showed above?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude03\n\n_Originally posted by @bartlomiej-bykowy in https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1570#discussioncomment-3803763_\n    ",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Open https://react-day-picker.js.org/start -Example\r\n2. Inspect today element(Button) observe the tabIndex is \"0\"\r\n3.  Navigate using Tab key focus moves from next(>) to today\r\n4. Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Open https://react-day-picker.js.org/start -Example\r\n2. Inspect today element(Button) observe the tabIndex is \"0\"\r\n3.  Navigate using Tab key focus moves from next(>) to today\r\n4. Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Open https://react-day-picker.js.org/start -Example\r\n2. Inspect today element(Button) observe the tabIndex is \"0\"\r\n3.  Navigate using Tab key focus moves from next(>) to today\r\n4. Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

I'm not opening new issue because I think it can be somehow related with this one \ud83d\ude42 \n\nSo, after updating to 8.3.1 this issue appeared:\n![Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 00 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106966230/194036711-c4b3b6fb-c0bc-4b0c-b3d9-951cf83767bf.png)\n\n`mode` and `selectedDate` comes from props. Their types are defined as follows:\n```\nmode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';\nselectedDate: DatesType\n```\n(and `DatesType: Date | Date[] | DateRange | undefined`, where `DateRange` is imported from `react-day-picker)\n\nAt this point I ran out of ideas how to resolve this issue. The only solution that worked, was something like this:\n```\n{ mode === 'single' && <DayPicker mode='single' selected={selectedDate as Date | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'multiple' && <DayPicker mode='multiple' selected={selectedDate as Date[] | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'range' && <DayPicker mode='range' selected={selectedDate as DateRange | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n```\nbut to be hones it doesn't look too clean.\n\nMaybe you would know what is the issue here and if there is a better way to resolve it than the one I showed above?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude03\n\n_Originally posted by @bartlomiej-bykowy in https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1570#discussioncomment-3803763_\n    ",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

Open https://react-day-picker.js.org/start -Example\r\n2. Inspect today element(Button) observe the tabIndex is \"0\"\r\n3.  Navigate using Tab key focus moves from next(>) to today\r\n4. Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

Open https://react-day-picker.js.org/start -Example\r\n2. Inspect today element(Button) observe the tabIndex is \"0\"\r\n3.  Navigate using Tab key focus moves from next(>) to today\r\n4. Observe the tabIndex of today button it is \"-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTabIndex of today button should be \"0\" \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8499692/196206042-6af5e6ea-af12-4041-9fc7-cd3ba1940742.png)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAfter focusing on today and the tabIndex is \"-1\", if we tab again it is moving header control(prev button)\r\n\r\n@gpbl, this issue is causing my focus loop logic. Due to the tabindex \"-1\", this element is not considered as focusable element and breaking out of the focus loop.\r\n",

I'm not opening new issue because I think it can be somehow related with this one \ud83d\ude42 \n\nSo, after updating to 8.3.1 this issue appeared:\n![Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 00 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106966230/194036711-c4b3b6fb-c0bc-4b0c-b3d9-951cf83767bf.png)\n\n`mode` and `selectedDate` comes from props. Their types are defined as follows:\n```\nmode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';\nselectedDate: DatesType\n```\n(and `DatesType: Date | Date[] | DateRange | undefined`, where `DateRange` is imported from `react-day-picker)\n\nAt this point I ran out of ideas how to resolve this issue. The only solution that worked, was something like this:\n```\n{ mode === 'single' && <DayPicker mode='single' selected={selectedDate as Date | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'multiple' && <DayPicker mode='multiple' selected={selectedDate as Date[] | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n{ mode === 'range' && <DayPicker mode='range' selected={selectedDate as DateRange | undefined} {...otherProps} /> }\n```\nbut to be hones it doesn't look too clean.\n\nMaybe you would know what is the issue here and if there is a better way to resolve it than the one I showed above?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude03\n\n_Originally posted by @bartlomiej-bykowy in https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1570#discussioncomment-3803763_\n    ",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",

I am a developer working on an [open source design system](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next) which uses `react-day-picker` for our [date picker component](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms/date-picker). \r\n\r\nWe've been doing some accessibility user testing sessions and a few of our screen reader users have said it would be nice to include the year in the label for each of the buttons inside the calendar. Without the year rendered in the label, if they forget what year they are in they need to jump to the top of the table to find that information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is very straight forward, we are just updating the default aria label of the day button to include the full year.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- <button aria-label=\"21st November (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n+ <button aria-label=\"21st November 2022 (Monday)\" {...} />\r\n```\r\n",
