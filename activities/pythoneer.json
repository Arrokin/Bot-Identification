Your problem is that you have to depend on poor to discover plugins with questionable quality that are not working together very well. It is not that plugins make your experience bad. If you could use helix without to depend on any plugins \u2013 it wouldn't make a difference in your use case. For helix to have a better plugins experience for people that want to use some \"fancy\" plugins there needs to be some way to have them easily discoverable and \u2013 at least for a set of the most popular/useful \u2013 to be better integrated and break each other etc. How you describe your problem it seems that NOT having plugins is NOT a solution. The solution is to have no bad plugins or at least a set of \"preinstalled\" plugins (that you don't even know of without digging) that would be useful for most of the user base.     ",

                "body": "@emummel20 I can only speak for myself, obviously. The reason i kinda turned my back on (Neo)Vim and are happily trying out helix (on and off) currently has not primarily to do with plugins but i think the problem is rooted in it. Let my explain: I tried many many times to create a setup that i see is fitting my needs. I spend endless hours just to arrive at some point with a barely working editor. Most of the time it was due to having to many plugins with questionable quality. So i started over and cut back the things that i don't really need but would be nice to have etc. and this circle start over every like 6-8 months. At some point you know your plugins and which to avoid (or checking out the quality from time to time) and which are even conflicting with another etc. \r\n\r\nBeing tired of this i started to look at projects like SpaceVim, LunarVim, AstroNVim etc. because in the end in don't want to have plugins i want an editor that is useful to me. And i think from a user perspective it does not matter how the functionality you like was coming from plugins or not. I still think that a plugin system could be valuable but not for the same reasons as it might be valuable to vim users. I know some people that are absolutely happy with vim and their setup and can't really understand why i am frustrated with it. That is ok. But i think the people that advocate to not have plugins are having the same problems. But i don't think its because of plugins rather than poor quality plugins that are not working together as a hole. As you newcomer you don't know which plugins are \"the best\" so you try some out and if you have bad luck you choose the wrong ones. \r\n\r\nWhat i would like to see is helix having plugins with a different spin. Plugins could be helpful just for the main developers them self just to quickly iterate over a feature or just having better separation/modularity in the code. I would like to see all the \"main\" functionality coming from a \"helix vetted\" plugin repository. Like you have your typical Linux distribution. All plugins in there are \"guaranteed\" to not be to bad and also work together and not break or interfere with each others functionality. Something like what projects like SpaceVim, LunarVim, AstroNVim wants to achieve. Outside of those \"core\" plugins you can have a \"AUR\" like community driven plugins space and all plugins in there need to respect the \"core\" plugins and try to not break them. There could be a ranking system etc. (out of scope here) but maybe if a \"AUR\" plugin is very successful and seems usable it could be adopted to the \"core\". \r\n\r\nI think most of the people that don't like plugins are especially against plugins but are against what comes out of it if there is no curation or any other system in place to weed out the bad ones or at least have an easy way to get a bunch of plugins that are useful and not constantly break.

Your problem is that you have to depend on poor to discover plugins with questionable quality that are not working together very well. It is not that plugins make your experience bad. If you could use helix without to depend on any plugins \u2013 it wouldn't make a difference in your use case. For helix to have a better plugins experience for people that want to use some \"fancy\" plugins there needs to be some way to have them easily discoverable and \u2013 at least for a set of the most popular/useful \u2013 to be better integrated and break each other etc. How you describe your problem it seems that NOT having plugins is NOT a solution. The solution is to have no bad plugins or at least a set of \"preinstalled\" plugins (that you don't even know of without digging) that would be useful for most of the user base.     ",

                "body": "@emummel20 I can only speak for myself, obviously. The reason i kinda turned my back on (Neo)Vim and are happily trying out helix (on and off) currently has not primarily to do with plugins but i think the problem is rooted in it. Let my explain: I tried many many times to create a setup that i see is fitting my needs. I spend endless hours just to arrive at some point with a barely working editor. Most of the time it was due to having to many plugins with questionable quality. So i started over and cut back the things that i don't really need but would be nice to have etc. and this circle start over every like 6-8 months. At some point you know your plugins and which to avoid (or checking out the quality from time to time) and which are even conflicting with another etc. \r\n\r\nBeing tired of this i started to look at projects like SpaceVim, LunarVim, AstroNVim etc. because in the end in don't want to have plugins i want an editor that is useful to me. And i think from a user perspective it does not matter how the functionality you like was coming from plugins or not. I still think that a plugin system could be valuable but not for the same reasons as it might be valuable to vim users. I know some people that are absolutely happy with vim and their setup and can't really understand why i am frustrated with it. That is ok. But i think the people that advocate to not have plugins are having the same problems. But i don't think its because of plugins rather than poor quality plugins that are not working together as a hole. As you newcomer you don't know which plugins are \"the best\" so you try some out and if you have bad luck you choose the wrong ones. \r\n\r\nWhat i would like to see is helix having plugins with a different spin. Plugins could be helpful just for the main developers them self just to quickly iterate over a feature or just having better separation/modularity in the code. I would like to see all the \"main\" functionality coming from a \"helix vetted\" plugin repository. Like you have your typical Linux distribution. All plugins in there are \"guaranteed\" to not be to bad and also work together and not break or interfere with each others functionality. Something like what projects like SpaceVim, LunarVim, AstroNVim wants to achieve. Outside of those \"core\" plugins you can have a \"AUR\" like community driven plugins space and all plugins in there need to respect the \"core\" plugins and try to not break them. There could be a ranking system etc. (out of scope here) but maybe if a \"AUR\" plugin is very successful and seems usable it could be adopted to the \"core\". \r\n\r\nI think most of the people that don't like plugins are especially against plugins but are against what comes out of it if there is no curation or any other system in place to weed out the bad ones or at least have an easy way to get a bunch of plugins that are useful and not constantly break.

Your problem is that you have to depend on poor to discover plugins with questionable quality that are not working together very well. It is not that plugins make your experience bad. If you could use helix without to depend on any plugins \u2013 it wouldn't make a difference in your use case. For helix to have a better plugins experience for people that want to use some \"fancy\" plugins there needs to be some way to have them easily discoverable and \u2013 at least for a set of the most popular/useful \u2013 to be better integrated and break each other etc. How you describe your problem it seems that NOT having plugins is NOT a solution. The solution is to have no bad plugins or at least a set of \"preinstalled\" plugins (that you don't even know of without digging) that would be useful for most of the user base.     ",

                "body": "@emummel20 I can only speak for myself, obviously. The reason i kinda turned my back on (Neo)Vim and are happily trying out helix (on and off) currently has not primarily to do with plugins but i think the problem is rooted in it. Let my explain: I tried many many times to create a setup that i see is fitting my needs. I spend endless hours just to arrive at some point with a barely working editor. Most of the time it was due to having to many plugins with questionable quality. So i started over and cut back the things that i don't really need but would be nice to have etc. and this circle start over every like 6-8 months. At some point you know your plugins and which to avoid (or checking out the quality from time to time) and which are even conflicting with another etc. \r\n\r\nBeing tired of this i started to look at projects like SpaceVim, LunarVim, AstroNVim etc. because in the end in don't want to have plugins i want an editor that is useful to me. And i think from a user perspective it does not matter how the functionality you like was coming from plugins or not. I still think that a plugin system could be valuable but not for the same reasons as it might be valuable to vim users. I know some people that are absolutely happy with vim and their setup and can't really understand why i am frustrated with it. That is ok. But i think the people that advocate to not have plugins are having the same problems. But i don't think its because of plugins rather than poor quality plugins that are not working together as a hole. As you newcomer you don't know which plugins are \"the best\" so you try some out and if you have bad luck you choose the wrong ones. \r\n\r\nWhat i would like to see is helix having plugins with a different spin. Plugins could be helpful just for the main developers them self just to quickly iterate over a feature or just having better separation/modularity in the code. I would like to see all the \"main\" functionality coming from a \"helix vetted\" plugin repository. Like you have your typical Linux distribution. All plugins in there are \"guaranteed\" to not be to bad and also work together and not break or interfere with each others functionality. Something like what projects like SpaceVim, LunarVim, AstroNVim wants to achieve. Outside of those \"core\" plugins you can have a \"AUR\" like community driven plugins space and all plugins in there need to respect the \"core\" plugins and try to not break them. There could be a ranking system etc. (out of scope here) but maybe if a \"AUR\" plugin is very successful and seems usable it could be adopted to the \"core\". \r\n\r\nI think most of the people that don't like plugins are especially against plugins but are against what comes out of it if there is no curation or any other system in place to weed out the bad ones or at least have an easy way to get a bunch of plugins that are useful and not constantly break.
