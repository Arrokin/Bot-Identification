Those are chars that will never follow in the matched chars (like `o` and `v`) typing one of those makers would jump there and typing either `o` or `v` would narrow down the possibilities. If i got that right \u2013 that is really cool to be honest. Because typing random sequences of letters that are littered across the screen is harder as just type the first (lets say 3) letters of the actual word you want to jump to and that would narrow it down quite dramatically and its what you already have in mind and is most likely a \"natural\" word that is not awkward to type like a random\"jy\" or \"kq\" that you actively need to think about because you might not have typed that combination for a long time if not ever.

Its always a little hard to figure out short gif/videos without trying it out yourself.\r\n\r\nSo if i have a text and started the \"jump mode\" and typed the first chars to where i want to jump like \r\n\r\n```\r\nrandom text\r\nwith <x>[acti]on\r\nand a little\r\nbit of <y>[acti]vity\r\nto see how this\r\nworks in,\r\nyou know, <z>[acti]on\r\n\r\ntyped: acti\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe text parts that would match my `acti` would be highlighted with a maker in front of it (x, y, z). Those are chars that will never follow in the matched chars (like `o` and `v`) typing one of those makers would jump there and typing either `o` or `v` would narrow down the possibilities. If i got that right \u2013 that is really cool to be honest. Because typing random sequences of letters that are littered across the screen is harder as just type the first (lets say 3) letters of the actual word you want to jump to and that would narrow it down quite dramatically and its what you already have in mind and is most likely a \"natural\" word that is not awkward to type like a random\"jy\" or \"kq\" that you actively need to think about because you might not have typed that combination for a long time if not ever.

Its always a little hard to figure out short gif/videos without trying it out yourself.\r\n\r\nSo if i have a text and started the \"jump mode\" and typed the first chars to where i want to jump like \r\n\r\n```\r\nrandom text\r\nwith <x>[acti]on\r\nand a little\r\nbit of <y>[acti]vity\r\nto see how this\r\nworks in,\r\nyou know, <z>[acti]on\r\n\r\ntyped: acti\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe text parts that would match my `acti` would be highlighted with a maker in front of it (x, y, z). Those are chars that will never follow in the matched chars (like `o` and `v`) typing one of those makers would jump there and typing either `o` or `v` would narrow down the possibilities. If i got that right \u2013 that is really cool to be honest. Because typing random sequences of letters that are littered across the screen is harder as just type the first (lets say 3) letters of the actual word you want to jump to and that would narrow it down quite dramatically and its what you already have in mind and is most likely a \"natural\" word that is not awkward to type like a random\"jy\" or \"kq\" that you actively need to think about because you might not have typed that combination for a long time if not ever.
