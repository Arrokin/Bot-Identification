                "body": "Our MacOS download provides a .dmg that, upon opening, only contains the OpenRefine application, without any other frills. It works, but it's barebones :-)\r\n\r\nI have just downloaded quite a bit of software, and I notice that many applications make their .dmg a bit fancier these days. They usually include a shortcut to the user's Applications folder, sometimes with a background image with some context/help that makes it easier and more obvious to the user that they can just drag the application there in order to install the software.\r\n\r\nSome applications also have backgrounds in that .dmg window, which makes everything look just a bit more polished, professional and friendly.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice: In my opinion: good to have that arrow + the project logo and a visual. The arrow looks amateurish though. Not sure if the licenses and readmes folders make any sense - I don't think anyone will ever click/open these?\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951265-bc3794d2-4f57-4859-ac0b-1ac9caed7830.png\">\r\n\r\nZotero: Simple but good, maybe a bit amateurish because of its simplicity.\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"image (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951522-e4483a35-aaa4-4941-a5f0-d46cab02e0a1.png\">\r\n\r\nVLC: Something in between. Balanced and subtle. Not bad IMO!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185952383-37660715-6e01-4812-82df-157e5037a489.png)\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nCan we do this too?\r\n* Highest priority IMO: the shortcut to the Applications folder\r\n* Nice to have but not necessary: a background with more context. I'd like that background to be nice and tasteful ;-)\r\n* We can talk about: what else makes sense to include in the window without making it too bloated? Perhaps we can even include something like a donation link? ;-) (not sure if that would be possible)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\nWe can also totally leave it like it is - it works. But I think it's a nice touch in general.\r\n\r\n### Funding available\r\n\r\nThe OpenRefine project has funding available to work on this. Do you know someone who would be able to get this fixed? Send them our way!\r\nhttps://openrefine.org/blog/2022/09/30/windows-macos-packaging.html",

                "body": "Our MacOS download provides a .dmg that, upon opening, only contains the OpenRefine application, without any other frills. It works, but it's barebones :-)\r\n\r\nI have just downloaded quite a bit of software, and I notice that many applications make their .dmg a bit fancier these days. They usually include a shortcut to the user's Applications folder, sometimes with a background image with some context/help that makes it easier and more obvious to the user that they can just drag the application there in order to install the software.\r\n\r\nSome applications also have backgrounds in that .dmg window, which makes everything look just a bit more polished, professional and friendly.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice: In my opinion: good to have that arrow + the project logo and a visual. The arrow looks amateurish though. Not sure if the licenses and readmes folders make any sense - I don't think anyone will ever click/open these?\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951265-bc3794d2-4f57-4859-ac0b-1ac9caed7830.png\">\r\n\r\nZotero: Simple but good, maybe a bit amateurish because of its simplicity.\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"image (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951522-e4483a35-aaa4-4941-a5f0-d46cab02e0a1.png\">\r\n\r\nVLC: Something in between. Balanced and subtle. Not bad IMO!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185952383-37660715-6e01-4812-82df-157e5037a489.png)\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nCan we do this too?\r\n* Highest priority IMO: the shortcut to the Applications folder\r\n* Nice to have but not necessary: a background with more context. I'd like that background to be nice and tasteful ;-)\r\n* We can talk about: what else makes sense to include in the window without making it too bloated? Perhaps we can even include something like a donation link? ;-) (not sure if that would be possible)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\nWe can also totally leave it like it is - it works. But I think it's a nice touch in general.\r\n\r\n### Funding available\r\n\r\nThe OpenRefine project has funding available to work on this. Do you know someone who would be able to get this fixed? Send them our way!\r\nhttps://openrefine.org/blog/2022/09/30/windows-macos-packaging.html",

                "body": "Our MacOS download provides a .dmg that, upon opening, only contains the OpenRefine application, without any other frills. It works, but it's barebones :-)\r\n\r\nI have just downloaded quite a bit of software, and I notice that many applications make their .dmg a bit fancier these days. They usually include a shortcut to the user's Applications folder, sometimes with a background image with some context/help that makes it easier and more obvious to the user that they can just drag the application there in order to install the software.\r\n\r\nSome applications also have backgrounds in that .dmg window, which makes everything look just a bit more polished, professional and friendly.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice: In my opinion: good to have that arrow + the project logo and a visual. The arrow looks amateurish though. Not sure if the licenses and readmes folders make any sense - I don't think anyone will ever click/open these?\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951265-bc3794d2-4f57-4859-ac0b-1ac9caed7830.png\">\r\n\r\nZotero: Simple but good, maybe a bit amateurish because of its simplicity.\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"image (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951522-e4483a35-aaa4-4941-a5f0-d46cab02e0a1.png\">\r\n\r\nVLC: Something in between. Balanced and subtle. Not bad IMO!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185952383-37660715-6e01-4812-82df-157e5037a489.png)\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nCan we do this too?\r\n* Highest priority IMO: the shortcut to the Applications folder\r\n* Nice to have but not necessary: a background with more context. I'd like that background to be nice and tasteful ;-)\r\n* We can talk about: what else makes sense to include in the window without making it too bloated? Perhaps we can even include something like a donation link? ;-) (not sure if that would be possible)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\nWe can also totally leave it like it is - it works. But I think it's a nice touch in general.\r\n\r\n### Funding available\r\n\r\nThe OpenRefine project has funding available to work on this. Do you know someone who would be able to get this fixed? Send them our way!\r\nhttps://openrefine.org/blog/2022/09/30/windows-macos-packaging.html",

                "body": "Our MacOS download provides a .dmg that, upon opening, only contains the OpenRefine application, without any other frills. It works, but it's barebones :-)\r\n\r\nI have just downloaded quite a bit of software, and I notice that many applications make their .dmg a bit fancier these days. They usually include a shortcut to the user's Applications folder, sometimes with a background image with some context/help that makes it easier and more obvious to the user that they can just drag the application there in order to install the software.\r\n\r\nSome applications also have backgrounds in that .dmg window, which makes everything look just a bit more polished, professional and friendly.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice: In my opinion: good to have that arrow + the project logo and a visual. The arrow looks amateurish though. Not sure if the licenses and readmes folders make any sense - I don't think anyone will ever click/open these?\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951265-bc3794d2-4f57-4859-ac0b-1ac9caed7830.png\">\r\n\r\nZotero: Simple but good, maybe a bit amateurish because of its simplicity.\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"image (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185951522-e4483a35-aaa4-4941-a5f0-d46cab02e0a1.png\">\r\n\r\nVLC: Something in between. Balanced and subtle. Not bad IMO!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9881645/185952383-37660715-6e01-4812-82df-157e5037a489.png)\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nCan we do this too?\r\n* Highest priority IMO: the shortcut to the Applications folder\r\n* Nice to have but not necessary: a background with more context. I'd like that background to be nice and tasteful ;-)\r\n* We can talk about: what else makes sense to include in the window without making it too bloated? Perhaps we can even include something like a donation link? ;-) (not sure if that would be possible)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\nWe can also totally leave it like it is - it works. But I think it's a nice touch in general.\r\n\r\n### Funding available\r\n\r\nThe OpenRefine project has funding available to work on this. Do you know someone who would be able to get this fixed? Send them our way!\r\nhttps://openrefine.org/blog/2022/09/30/windows-macos-packaging.html",
