Other automated migrations might also be possible in future.\r\n\r\nThe user needs to migrate not because \"they are upgrading to X\" but rather \"their project is in a format that Cypress no longer recognizes\".\n\n### Other\n\n_No response_",

Examples: https://on.cypress.io/changelog\r\nIf the change is not user-facing, write \"n/a\".\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUser will no longer see \"Open in IDE\" in the command log for component tests\r\n\r\n### Additional details\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n- Why was this change necessary?\r\n- What is affected by this change?\r\n- Any implementation details to explain?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis button doesn't work for CT. As a part of the GA effort, we should remove this button from CT so that users don't try to click it.

Run Cypress\r\n2. Open e2e tests\r\n3. Run a spec\r\n4. While the spec is running, hover over the \"test body\" section of the command log and verify that you still see the \"Open in IDE\" button on hover\r\n5. Click the button and verify that you are taken to the spec file in your configured IDE\r\n6. Open Component Testing\r\n7. Run a CT spec\r\n8. While the spec is running, hover over the same spot in the command log and verify that the \"Open in IDE\" button is **not** rendered\r\n\r\n### PR Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\nThese tasks must be completed before a PR is merged.\r\nIf a task does not apply, write [na] instead of checking the box.\r\nDO NOT DELETE the PR checklist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Have tests been added/updated?\r\n- [x] Has the original issue (or this PR, if no issue exists) been tagged with a release in ZenHub?

This is stored as a global user preference, not at the project level.\r\n\r\nThis Welcome screen appears as the first screen in the launchpad and is blocking until it is dismissed with the \"Continue\" button. Regardless of whether the user is opening in global mode, project mode, or with `--testingType` and `--browser` CLI flags, this will be the first thing they see.\r\n\r\nClicking \"Continue\" always leads to the appropriate next step in the launchpad based on how Cypress was opened. These steps can be:\r\n\r\n- migration helper \r\n- global page\r\n- testing type picker \r\n- browser picker with browser not launched (if only `--testingType` flag was passed)\r\n- browser picker with browser opening (if in project mode and `--testingType` and `--browser` flags were both passed)\r\n\r\nFor context when reviewing this PR, there are a few decisions to call out about how this system will work (at least, for now):\r\n\r\n#### `LocalSettingsActions`\r\nI've updated how `LocalSettingsActions.setPreferences` works to perform a merge with existing settings in stead of fully overwriting the properties. We took a crack at this in #23762 but didn't implement correctly. I've removed the unit test that was added in that PR since, though it passed, it was testing the wrong thing. This merge approach allows setting state in nested objects, which is important as we now have 3 kinds of objects in state.json files - `banners`, `promptsShown`, and `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed`. `promptsShown` has a custom mutation and action just for merging this property, `banners` is merged with existing state on the clientside before being set. I haven't cleaned those up here, but will do so in #23768. We can also probably simplify the overall patterns (deeper in the server) around getting/setting saved state from the file system, as discussed with @warrensplayer, as it can be pretty difficult to debug an issue in this area.\r\n\r\n#### How we are managing the new content\r\nThis PR introduces some article-like content that's different from most of the existing content in `en-US.json`. `MajorVersionWelcome.vue` is storing that content as plain HTML instead of the i18n system so that we can be flexible with the needs of each \"post\". Treating this content as \"rich text\" in this way makes it easier to understand what is being rendered. New static text like button labels and titles have still been added to i18n.\r\n\r\nThe Welcome content needs to be updated before each major release to highlight new features and breaking changes, so there will always be some custom markup here that will change major-to-major. Most of this content isn't asserted in tests - the interactive elements are, and we have Percy snapshots of the article as a whole. \r\n\r\nI've added a constant `MAJOR_VERSION_FOR_CONTENT` that defines the major version number that needs to be looked up in state to see if the welcome page was dismissed. We check this a few places, including on the server before launching a browser. This constant should only change in a release branch for new major versions & allows us to set up the correct content and behavior before the version actually exists.\r\n\r\nThe other consideration here is for this content to not rely on and API & work correctly even offline, so everything user-facing is hard coded, even things like release dates that could come from `VersionsDataSource` - we know what they are, so we can put them in the code.\r\n\r\n#### Launchpad e2e tests\r\nSince this is a new starting point for the launchpad, all launchpad e2e tests need to deal with it in some way. Following our existing patterns I added a `cy.skipWelcome()` custom command which is called in many places after `cy.visitLaunchpad()`. It can't be fully bound up with `cy.visitLaunchpad()` since there are cases where it will not be there to be dismissed. Some tests visit the launchpad more than once & this is a good thing - on the second visit it should be reading the value stored in global preferences and not show the Welcome page. In some cases I stubbed `localSettingsApi.getPreferences` to return the state with the current major version already dismissed - which seems good but is a lot more verbose. While this is in review I'll take a look at ways to simplify this - maybe add a parameter to `visitLaunchpad`, but the main thing is the tests are functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to test\r\n<!--\r\nFor non-trivial behavior changes, list the steps that a reviewer should follow to validate the new behavior.\r\nThis is not meant to be the only testing performed by a reviewer, just the \"happy path\" that leads to the new behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of detail but the test process is pretty quick.\r\n\r\n**Basic Test**\r\n- open `projects/__global__/state.json` in your favorite IDE, it should not have a `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` property\r\n- run `yarn dev` - Cypress should open at the launchpad and you should see the \"What's New in Cypress\" content\r\n- Click the continue button - you should see the \"Choose Testing Type\" screen\r\n- notice that an object that looks like this has appeared in your `state.json`: \r\n```json\r\n\"majorVersionWelcomeDismissed\": {\r\n    \"11\": 1667570082797\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n- refresh the launchpad - it should not show the welcome screen\r\n\r\n**Detailed test of state.json expectations**\r\n- delete `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` and refresh the launchpad - it should show the welcome screen again\r\n- click continue as before\r\n- `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` should be back in the `state.json` now\r\n- add some sibling properties and remove `\"11\"` from the object.\r\n- refresh the launchpad, it should show the welcome page again\r\n- click continue\r\n- a new `\"11\"` key should be added in `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` without blowing away the sibling properties.\r\n- kill and restart Cypress\r\n- you should not see the welcome screen\r\n\r\nI suggest doing the basic+detailed test once, and just the basic test for the following situations to verify the user reaches the expected next step:\r\n\r\n1. opening with a project and no flags\r\n2. opening with a project and `--testingType` flag\r\n3. opening with a project and `--testingType` and `--browser` flags\r\n4. opening with a project that has a `cypress.json` instead of `cypress.config.ts`\r\n5. opening in global mode\r\n\r\nAlso tab to the continue button and makes sure you can use it with space and enter keys - keyboard access to dismiss a fully-blocking state is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How has the user experience changed?\r\n<!-- Provide before and after examples of the change.\r\nScreenshots or GIFs are preferred. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\nThese tasks must be completed before a PR is merged.\r\nIf a task does not apply, write [na] instead of checking the box.\r\nDO NOT DELETE the PR checklist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have tests been added/updated?\r\n- [ ] Has the original issue (or this PR, if no issue exists) been tagged with a release in ZenHub? (user-facing changes only)\r\n- [ ] Has a PR for user-facing changes been opened in [`cypress-documentation`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation)? <!-- Link to PR here -->\r\n- [ ] Have API changes been updated in the [`type definitions`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts)?\r\n",

(user-facing changes only)\r\n- [TODO] Has a PR for user-facing changes been opened in [`cypress-documentation`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation)? <!-- Link to PR here -->\r\n- [n/a] Have API changes been updated in the [`type definitions`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts)?\r\n",

Other automated migrations might also be possible in future.\r\n\r\nThe user needs to migrate not because \"they are upgrading to X\" but rather \"their project is in a format that Cypress no longer recognizes\".\n\n### Other\n\n_No response_",

Examples: https://on.cypress.io/changelog\r\nIf the change is not user-facing, write \"n/a\".\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUser will no longer see \"Open in IDE\" in the command log for component tests\r\n\r\n### Additional details\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n- Why was this change necessary?\r\n- What is affected by this change?\r\n- Any implementation details to explain?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis button doesn't work for CT. As a part of the GA effort, we should remove this button from CT so that users don't try to click it.

Run Cypress\r\n2. Open e2e tests\r\n3. Run a spec\r\n4. While the spec is running, hover over the \"test body\" section of the command log and verify that you still see the \"Open in IDE\" button on hover\r\n5. Click the button and verify that you are taken to the spec file in your configured IDE\r\n6. Open Component Testing\r\n7. Run a CT spec\r\n8. While the spec is running, hover over the same spot in the command log and verify that the \"Open in IDE\" button is **not** rendered\r\n\r\n### PR Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\nThese tasks must be completed before a PR is merged.\r\nIf a task does not apply, write [na] instead of checking the box.\r\nDO NOT DELETE the PR checklist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Have tests been added/updated?\r\n- [x] Has the original issue (or this PR, if no issue exists) been tagged with a release in ZenHub?

This is stored as a global user preference, not at the project level.\r\n\r\nThis Welcome screen appears as the first screen in the launchpad and is blocking until it is dismissed with the \"Continue\" button. Regardless of whether the user is opening in global mode, project mode, or with `--testingType` and `--browser` CLI flags, this will be the first thing they see.\r\n\r\nClicking \"Continue\" always leads to the appropriate next step in the launchpad based on how Cypress was opened. These steps can be:\r\n\r\n- migration helper \r\n- global page\r\n- testing type picker \r\n- browser picker with browser not launched (if only `--testingType` flag was passed)\r\n- browser picker with browser opening (if in project mode and `--testingType` and `--browser` flags were both passed)\r\n\r\nFor context when reviewing this PR, there are a few decisions to call out about how this system will work (at least, for now):\r\n\r\n#### `LocalSettingsActions`\r\nI've updated how `LocalSettingsActions.setPreferences` works to perform a merge with existing settings in stead of fully overwriting the properties. We took a crack at this in #23762 but didn't implement correctly. I've removed the unit test that was added in that PR since, though it passed, it was testing the wrong thing. This merge approach allows setting state in nested objects, which is important as we now have 3 kinds of objects in state.json files - `banners`, `promptsShown`, and `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed`. `promptsShown` has a custom mutation and action just for merging this property, `banners` is merged with existing state on the clientside before being set. I haven't cleaned those up here, but will do so in #23768. We can also probably simplify the overall patterns (deeper in the server) around getting/setting saved state from the file system, as discussed with @warrensplayer, as it can be pretty difficult to debug an issue in this area.\r\n\r\n#### How we are managing the new content\r\nThis PR introduces some article-like content that's different from most of the existing content in `en-US.json`. `MajorVersionWelcome.vue` is storing that content as plain HTML instead of the i18n system so that we can be flexible with the needs of each \"post\". Treating this content as \"rich text\" in this way makes it easier to understand what is being rendered. New static text like button labels and titles have still been added to i18n.\r\n\r\nThe Welcome content needs to be updated before each major release to highlight new features and breaking changes, so there will always be some custom markup here that will change major-to-major. Most of this content isn't asserted in tests - the interactive elements are, and we have Percy snapshots of the article as a whole. \r\n\r\nI've added a constant `MAJOR_VERSION_FOR_CONTENT` that defines the major version number that needs to be looked up in state to see if the welcome page was dismissed. We check this a few places, including on the server before launching a browser. This constant should only change in a release branch for new major versions & allows us to set up the correct content and behavior before the version actually exists.\r\n\r\nThe other consideration here is for this content to not rely on and API & work correctly even offline, so everything user-facing is hard coded, even things like release dates that could come from `VersionsDataSource` - we know what they are, so we can put them in the code.\r\n\r\n#### Launchpad e2e tests\r\nSince this is a new starting point for the launchpad, all launchpad e2e tests need to deal with it in some way. Following our existing patterns I added a `cy.skipWelcome()` custom command which is called in many places after `cy.visitLaunchpad()`. It can't be fully bound up with `cy.visitLaunchpad()` since there are cases where it will not be there to be dismissed. Some tests visit the launchpad more than once & this is a good thing - on the second visit it should be reading the value stored in global preferences and not show the Welcome page. In some cases I stubbed `localSettingsApi.getPreferences` to return the state with the current major version already dismissed - which seems good but is a lot more verbose. While this is in review I'll take a look at ways to simplify this - maybe add a parameter to `visitLaunchpad`, but the main thing is the tests are functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to test\r\n<!--\r\nFor non-trivial behavior changes, list the steps that a reviewer should follow to validate the new behavior.\r\nThis is not meant to be the only testing performed by a reviewer, just the \"happy path\" that leads to the new behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of detail but the test process is pretty quick.\r\n\r\n**Basic Test**\r\n- open `projects/__global__/state.json` in your favorite IDE, it should not have a `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` property\r\n- run `yarn dev` - Cypress should open at the launchpad and you should see the \"What's New in Cypress\" content\r\n- Click the continue button - you should see the \"Choose Testing Type\" screen\r\n- notice that an object that looks like this has appeared in your `state.json`: \r\n```json\r\n\"majorVersionWelcomeDismissed\": {\r\n    \"11\": 1667570082797\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n- refresh the launchpad - it should not show the welcome screen\r\n\r\n**Detailed test of state.json expectations**\r\n- delete `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` and refresh the launchpad - it should show the welcome screen again\r\n- click continue as before\r\n- `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` should be back in the `state.json` now\r\n- add some sibling properties and remove `\"11\"` from the object.\r\n- refresh the launchpad, it should show the welcome page again\r\n- click continue\r\n- a new `\"11\"` key should be added in `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` without blowing away the sibling properties.\r\n- kill and restart Cypress\r\n- you should not see the welcome screen\r\n\r\nI suggest doing the basic+detailed test once, and just the basic test for the following situations to verify the user reaches the expected next step:\r\n\r\n1. opening with a project and no flags\r\n2. opening with a project and `--testingType` flag\r\n3. opening with a project and `--testingType` and `--browser` flags\r\n4. opening with a project that has a `cypress.json` instead of `cypress.config.ts`\r\n5. opening in global mode\r\n\r\nAlso tab to the continue button and makes sure you can use it with space and enter keys - keyboard access to dismiss a fully-blocking state is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How has the user experience changed?\r\n<!-- Provide before and after examples of the change.\r\nScreenshots or GIFs are preferred. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\nThese tasks must be completed before a PR is merged.\r\nIf a task does not apply, write [na] instead of checking the box.\r\nDO NOT DELETE the PR checklist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have tests been added/updated?\r\n- [ ] Has the original issue (or this PR, if no issue exists) been tagged with a release in ZenHub? (user-facing changes only)\r\n- [ ] Has a PR for user-facing changes been opened in [`cypress-documentation`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation)? <!-- Link to PR here -->\r\n- [ ] Have API changes been updated in the [`type definitions`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts)?\r\n",

(user-facing changes only)\r\n- [TODO] Has a PR for user-facing changes been opened in [`cypress-documentation`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation)? <!-- Link to PR here -->\r\n- [n/a] Have API changes been updated in the [`type definitions`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts)?\r\n",

Other automated migrations might also be possible in future.\r\n\r\nThe user needs to migrate not because \"they are upgrading to X\" but rather \"their project is in a format that Cypress no longer recognizes\".\n\n### Other\n\n_No response_",

Examples: https://on.cypress.io/changelog\r\nIf the change is not user-facing, write \"n/a\".\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUser will no longer see \"Open in IDE\" in the command log for component tests\r\n\r\n### Additional details\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n- Why was this change necessary?\r\n- What is affected by this change?\r\n- Any implementation details to explain?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis button doesn't work for CT. As a part of the GA effort, we should remove this button from CT so that users don't try to click it.

Run Cypress\r\n2. Open e2e tests\r\n3. Run a spec\r\n4. While the spec is running, hover over the \"test body\" section of the command log and verify that you still see the \"Open in IDE\" button on hover\r\n5. Click the button and verify that you are taken to the spec file in your configured IDE\r\n6. Open Component Testing\r\n7. Run a CT spec\r\n8. While the spec is running, hover over the same spot in the command log and verify that the \"Open in IDE\" button is **not** rendered\r\n\r\n### PR Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\nThese tasks must be completed before a PR is merged.\r\nIf a task does not apply, write [na] instead of checking the box.\r\nDO NOT DELETE the PR checklist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Have tests been added/updated?\r\n- [x] Has the original issue (or this PR, if no issue exists) been tagged with a release in ZenHub?

This is stored as a global user preference, not at the project level.\r\n\r\nThis Welcome screen appears as the first screen in the launchpad and is blocking until it is dismissed with the \"Continue\" button. Regardless of whether the user is opening in global mode, project mode, or with `--testingType` and `--browser` CLI flags, this will be the first thing they see.\r\n\r\nClicking \"Continue\" always leads to the appropriate next step in the launchpad based on how Cypress was opened. These steps can be:\r\n\r\n- migration helper \r\n- global page\r\n- testing type picker \r\n- browser picker with browser not launched (if only `--testingType` flag was passed)\r\n- browser picker with browser opening (if in project mode and `--testingType` and `--browser` flags were both passed)\r\n\r\nFor context when reviewing this PR, there are a few decisions to call out about how this system will work (at least, for now):\r\n\r\n#### `LocalSettingsActions`\r\nI've updated how `LocalSettingsActions.setPreferences` works to perform a merge with existing settings in stead of fully overwriting the properties. We took a crack at this in #23762 but didn't implement correctly. I've removed the unit test that was added in that PR since, though it passed, it was testing the wrong thing. This merge approach allows setting state in nested objects, which is important as we now have 3 kinds of objects in state.json files - `banners`, `promptsShown`, and `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed`. `promptsShown` has a custom mutation and action just for merging this property, `banners` is merged with existing state on the clientside before being set. I haven't cleaned those up here, but will do so in #23768. We can also probably simplify the overall patterns (deeper in the server) around getting/setting saved state from the file system, as discussed with @warrensplayer, as it can be pretty difficult to debug an issue in this area.\r\n\r\n#### How we are managing the new content\r\nThis PR introduces some article-like content that's different from most of the existing content in `en-US.json`. `MajorVersionWelcome.vue` is storing that content as plain HTML instead of the i18n system so that we can be flexible with the needs of each \"post\". Treating this content as \"rich text\" in this way makes it easier to understand what is being rendered. New static text like button labels and titles have still been added to i18n.\r\n\r\nThe Welcome content needs to be updated before each major release to highlight new features and breaking changes, so there will always be some custom markup here that will change major-to-major. Most of this content isn't asserted in tests - the interactive elements are, and we have Percy snapshots of the article as a whole. \r\n\r\nI've added a constant `MAJOR_VERSION_FOR_CONTENT` that defines the major version number that needs to be looked up in state to see if the welcome page was dismissed. We check this a few places, including on the server before launching a browser. This constant should only change in a release branch for new major versions & allows us to set up the correct content and behavior before the version actually exists.\r\n\r\nThe other consideration here is for this content to not rely on and API & work correctly even offline, so everything user-facing is hard coded, even things like release dates that could come from `VersionsDataSource` - we know what they are, so we can put them in the code.\r\n\r\n#### Launchpad e2e tests\r\nSince this is a new starting point for the launchpad, all launchpad e2e tests need to deal with it in some way. Following our existing patterns I added a `cy.skipWelcome()` custom command which is called in many places after `cy.visitLaunchpad()`. It can't be fully bound up with `cy.visitLaunchpad()` since there are cases where it will not be there to be dismissed. Some tests visit the launchpad more than once & this is a good thing - on the second visit it should be reading the value stored in global preferences and not show the Welcome page. In some cases I stubbed `localSettingsApi.getPreferences` to return the state with the current major version already dismissed - which seems good but is a lot more verbose. While this is in review I'll take a look at ways to simplify this - maybe add a parameter to `visitLaunchpad`, but the main thing is the tests are functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to test\r\n<!--\r\nFor non-trivial behavior changes, list the steps that a reviewer should follow to validate the new behavior.\r\nThis is not meant to be the only testing performed by a reviewer, just the \"happy path\" that leads to the new behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of detail but the test process is pretty quick.\r\n\r\n**Basic Test**\r\n- open `projects/__global__/state.json` in your favorite IDE, it should not have a `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` property\r\n- run `yarn dev` - Cypress should open at the launchpad and you should see the \"What's New in Cypress\" content\r\n- Click the continue button - you should see the \"Choose Testing Type\" screen\r\n- notice that an object that looks like this has appeared in your `state.json`: \r\n```json\r\n\"majorVersionWelcomeDismissed\": {\r\n    \"11\": 1667570082797\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n- refresh the launchpad - it should not show the welcome screen\r\n\r\n**Detailed test of state.json expectations**\r\n- delete `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` and refresh the launchpad - it should show the welcome screen again\r\n- click continue as before\r\n- `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` should be back in the `state.json` now\r\n- add some sibling properties and remove `\"11\"` from the object.\r\n- refresh the launchpad, it should show the welcome page again\r\n- click continue\r\n- a new `\"11\"` key should be added in `majorVersionWelcomeDismissed` without blowing away the sibling properties.\r\n- kill and restart Cypress\r\n- you should not see the welcome screen\r\n\r\nI suggest doing the basic+detailed test once, and just the basic test for the following situations to verify the user reaches the expected next step:\r\n\r\n1. opening with a project and no flags\r\n2. opening with a project and `--testingType` flag\r\n3. opening with a project and `--testingType` and `--browser` flags\r\n4. opening with a project that has a `cypress.json` instead of `cypress.config.ts`\r\n5. opening in global mode\r\n\r\nAlso tab to the continue button and makes sure you can use it with space and enter keys - keyboard access to dismiss a fully-blocking state is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How has the user experience changed?\r\n<!-- Provide before and after examples of the change.\r\nScreenshots or GIFs are preferred. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\nThese tasks must be completed before a PR is merged.\r\nIf a task does not apply, write [na] instead of checking the box.\r\nDO NOT DELETE the PR checklist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have tests been added/updated?\r\n- [ ] Has the original issue (or this PR, if no issue exists) been tagged with a release in ZenHub? (user-facing changes only)\r\n- [ ] Has a PR for user-facing changes been opened in [`cypress-documentation`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation)? <!-- Link to PR here -->\r\n- [ ] Have API changes been updated in the [`type definitions`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts)?\r\n",

(user-facing changes only)\r\n- [TODO] Has a PR for user-facing changes been opened in [`cypress-documentation`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation)? <!-- Link to PR here -->\r\n- [n/a] Have API changes been updated in the [`type definitions`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts)?\r\n",
