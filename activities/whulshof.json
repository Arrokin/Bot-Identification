Bcs also the current price is inside of the attributes, it is hourly updated indeed. If you remove those, it really will do as you say, update once or twice a day.\r\nBut it was a question. Compared to many other state's and attributes you/we now have a modest update frequency, which is perfectly ok for me. Thanks for your answer!\r\nCan be closed!",

                "body": "Hi, you have built a great integration. Thanks for that.\r\nI have an electric car and heat pumps as heating solution. No gas anymore. \r\nOn colder days in winter the heat pumps (2) regularly use some 150 kWh per day and let's say the Tesla on average will need some 40 kWh after it has been used. And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned together with the prices of the day ahead prices of the day after that. The prices could go up so the 9 hours of the running day could become more interesting. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",

The sensors in this integration are still pretty useful for those things.\r\n\r\nBut that is terribly non-principle. With an ordered list you would do much better, because you know you need the heat pump every day or maybe every two days. So if you can't wait anymore to switch it on within 24 hours the 50% condition is not leading to a warm house if the difference between expensive and cheap hours is not a factor 2 or more.",

                "body": "Hi, you have built a great integration. Thanks for that.\r\nI have an electric car and heat pumps as heating solution. No gas anymore. \r\nOn colder days in winter the heat pumps (2) regularly use some 150 kWh per day and let's say the Tesla on average will need some 40 kWh after it has been used. And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned together with the prices of the day ahead prices of the day after that. The prices could go up so the 9 hours of the running day could become more interesting. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",

Bcs also the current price is inside of the attributes, it is hourly updated indeed. If you remove those, it really will do as you say, update once or twice a day.\r\nBut it was a question. Compared to many other state's and attributes you/we now have a modest update frequency, which is perfectly ok for me. Thanks for your answer!\r\nCan be closed!",

                "body": "Hi, you have built a great integration. Thanks for that.\r\nI have an electric car and heat pumps as heating solution. No gas anymore. \r\nOn colder days in winter the heat pumps (2) regularly use some 150 kWh per day and let's say the Tesla on average will need some 40 kWh after it has been used. And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned together with the prices of the day ahead prices of the day after that. The prices could go up so the 9 hours of the running day could become more interesting. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",

With an ordered list you would do much better, because you know you need the heat pump every day or maybe every two days. So if you can't wait anymore to switch it on within 24 hours the 50% condition is not leading to a warm house if the difference between expensive and cheap hours is not a factor 2 or more.",

No gas anymore. \r\nOn colder days in winter the heat pumps (2) regularly use some 150 kWh per day and let's say the Tesla on average will need some 40 kWh after it has been used. And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned together with the prices of the day ahead prices of the day after that. The prices could go up so the 9 hours of the running day could become more interesting. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",

And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned together with the prices of the day ahead prices of the day after that. The prices could go up so the 9 hours of the running day could become more interesting. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",

                "body": "Hi, you have built a great integration. Thanks for that.\r\nI have an electric car and heat pumps as heating solution. No gas anymore. \r\nOn colder days in winter the heat pumps (2) regularly use some 150 kWh per day and let's say the Tesla on average will need some 40 kWh after it has been used. And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned together with the prices of the day ahead prices of the day after that. The prices could go up so the 9 hours of the running day could become more interesting. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",

The sensors in this integration are still pretty useful for those things.\r\n\r\nBut that is terribly non-principle. With an ordered list you would do much better, because you know you need the heat pump every day or maybe every two days. So if you can't wait anymore to switch it on within 24 hours the 50% condition is not leading to a warm house if the difference between expensive and cheap hours is not a factor 2 or more.",

                "body": "Hi, you have built a great integration. Thanks for that.\r\nI have an electric car and heat pumps as heating solution. No gas anymore. \r\nOn colder days in winter the heat pumps (2) regularly use some 150 kWh per day and let's say the Tesla on average will need some 40 kWh after it has been used. And apart from that I use  some 50 kWh per day on lights, pumps, cooking, washing etc.\r\nSo I'll really want to optimise electricity use to the hours with lowest price as published by entsoe to profit from the heat pump and EV investment.\r\nNow I was thinking at 15.00 the prices of next day become available and say at 15.01 hass could run an optimisation program to calculate the best hours to use electricity for the coming 33 hours, taking into account the necessary forecasted kWh and the typical use per device. Ofcourse the next day at 15.00 hours the first 9 hours will be replanned with the prices of the day ahead. \r\nMy problem is that I don't have much use for the sensors, that are available now, since they are not stating the time and averages do not bring me much. \r\nI would rather have an ordered list of hour-prices, so that I can just take the beginning of the list to plan my use up and until the forecasted kWh's are reached and then the actual order of the hours will be kicking in again. I'm assuming I can buffer heat as much as necessary within a day and the car does not have to be fully charged every morning. This assumption will not be always valid, but as a working assumption it's ok.\r\nHow can I get at the ordered list for the next 33 hours at or around 15.00 hrs the easiest do you think? If I have my optimiser I will make a PR for the interested or a separate integration/automation if that should be better.\r\n\r\n",
