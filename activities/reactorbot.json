While we don't expect this to be an issue in most\r\nproduction applications, this can lead to hitting native thread limits\r\nfaster. Notably, stress tests around graceful disposal create a lot of\r\nschedulers for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThis change also ensures that the evictor executorServices of both the\r\nBoundedElasticScheduler and ElasticScheduler are limited to at most 1\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nFinally, it attempts to improve the SchedulersStressTest to avoid the\r\nOOMs as much as possible: block on disposeGracefully() calls, increase\r\nthe heap of forked JVMs for jcstress, and ultimately stop covering the\r\nBoundedElasticScheduler in the stress test.\r\n\r\nFixes #3258.",

This change still uses the `FluxPublish` class to implement the logic, however with a few minor changes to its implementation.\r\nFirst of all, `FluxPublish` resets itself after source termination to be able to `connect()` again. `FluxReplay` on the other hand, does not reset itself in the case of only buffering signals without timeout. Therefore, for the behaviour of caching the terminals, `FluxPublish` does not reset itself and replays the terminal when it receives a late subscription.\r\nFor cases with expiry (TTL arguments), `FluxReplay` does indeed reset itself. Therefore, the behaviour for the time constrained values remains as before, using `FluxPublish` implementation for the `0` history case, but without caching terminals, while not honouring the TTL. This case can be later implemented if needed.",

Additionally, a MODIFIED class is\nmarked with ***. This task attempts at pinpointing the incompatible\nchanges only in the report, and printing these lines.\n\nThis report is called out in the \"how to fix\" tip in the CI preliminary\nstep.\n\n2) Ensure sourceModified changes are considered\n\nSee reactor/reactor#722.\n\nIf a change is binary compatible but not source compatible, using\n`onlyBinaryCompatibleModified = true` will mask the issue. This\nchange uses `onlyModified = true` instead. This is slightly more\nverbose, but this is alleviated by (1).\n\n3) Update japicmp-gradle-plugin, exclude NEW_DEFAULT_METHOD as a whole\n\nSince japicmp-grale-plugin v0.4.1 the new `compatibilityChangeExcludes`\nparameter allows us to ignore all occurrences of a default method added\nto an interface, instead of having to exclude each such method one by\none.\n",

Additionally, a MODIFIED class is\nmarked with ***. This task attempts at pinpointing the incompatible\nchanges only in the report, and printing these lines.\n\n2) Ensure sourceModified changes are considered\nSee reactor/reactor#722.\nIf a change is binary compatible but not source compatible, using\n`onlyBinaryCompatibleModified = true` will mask the issue. This\nchange uses `onlyModified = true` instead. This is slightly more\nverbose, but this is alleviated by (1).\n\n3) Bump to japicmp plugin v0.4.1, exclude NEW_DEFAULT_METHOD as a whole\nThe new `compatibilityChangeExcludes` parameter allows us to ignore all\noccurrences of a default method added to an interface, instead of\nhaving to exclude each such method one by one.\n\nThe fourth commit demonstrates the console report and its filtering,\nand shows that out of the two added interface methods, only the\nnon-default one is reported.",

There might be better solutions, maybe you have suggestions ?\r\n     - I've thought about using `StampedLock` instead of `synchronized`, but I decided to leave it aside and provide a simpler code for first review \r\n - I've added a regression test for the concurrent error, but I would appreciate advise on how I could improve it because:\r\n    - Failure is inconsistent due to the concurrent nature of the problem. I could add a loop to the test, to force failure behavior, but I'm afraid that it would make it too long to execute.\r\n    - Maybe it is too heavy, as it starts its own thread-pool.\r\n - Independently from the current issue, I've seen that there's a duplicated function `format` used both on console logger and JDK logger. I wonder if it is really needed on JdkLogger, because this work should be done internally by the logger. If you agree, I can rework that as a bonus in this PR.\r\n",

In the case of scalar fusion at flatMap operators ( https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/main/reactor-core/src/main/java/reactor/core/publisher/FluxFlatMap.java#L118) the inner chain may be fused with the outer downstream. Since `onLastOperator` must be applied to the inner chain, modification added by the call may break fusion which leads to the `ClastCastException`\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: OlegDokuka <odokuka@vmware.com>",

In some scenarios, that is undesired as it does not allow proper cleanup.\r\n`Scheduler`s should allow shutting down by not accepting new work, but giving the currently executing tasks a chance to finish without interruption. A `Mono<Void> disposeGracefully()` method has been added for that purpose. Upon subscription, it calls `shutdown()` instead of `shutdownNow()` and creates a background task that does `awaitTermination()` to complete the returned `Mono`. It can be combined with `timeout()` and `retry()` operators in realistic scenarios.",

While we don't expect this to be an issue in most\r\nproduction applications, this can lead to hitting native thread limits\r\nfaster. Notably, stress tests around graceful disposal create a lot of\r\nschedulers for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThis change also ensures that the evictor executorServices of both the\r\nBoundedElasticScheduler and ElasticScheduler are limited to at most 1\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nFinally, it attempts to improve the SchedulersStressTest to avoid the\r\nOOMs as much as possible: block on disposeGracefully() calls, increase\r\nthe heap of forked JVMs for jcstress, and ultimately stop covering the\r\nBoundedElasticScheduler in the stress test.\r\n\r\nFixes #3258.",

This change still uses the `FluxPublish` class to implement the logic, however with a few minor changes to its implementation.\r\nFirst of all, `FluxPublish` resets itself after source termination to be able to `connect()` again. `FluxReplay` on the other hand, does not reset itself in the case of only buffering signals without timeout. Therefore, for the behaviour of caching the terminals, `FluxPublish` does not reset itself and replays the terminal when it receives a late subscription.\r\nFor cases with expiry (TTL arguments), `FluxReplay` does indeed reset itself. Therefore, the behaviour for the time constrained values remains as before, using `FluxPublish` implementation for the `0` history case, but without caching terminals, while not honouring the TTL. This case can be later implemented if needed.",

Additionally, a MODIFIED class is\nmarked with ***. This task attempts at pinpointing the incompatible\nchanges only in the report, and printing these lines.\n\nThis report is called out in the \"how to fix\" tip in the CI preliminary\nstep.\n\n2) Ensure sourceModified changes are considered\n\nSee reactor/reactor#722.\n\nIf a change is binary compatible but not source compatible, using\n`onlyBinaryCompatibleModified = true` will mask the issue. This\nchange uses `onlyModified = true` instead. This is slightly more\nverbose, but this is alleviated by (1).\n\n3) Update japicmp-gradle-plugin, exclude NEW_DEFAULT_METHOD as a whole\n\nSince japicmp-grale-plugin v0.4.1 the new `compatibilityChangeExcludes`\nparameter allows us to ignore all occurrences of a default method added\nto an interface, instead of having to exclude each such method one by\none.\n",

Additionally, a MODIFIED class is\nmarked with ***. This task attempts at pinpointing the incompatible\nchanges only in the report, and printing these lines.\n\n2) Ensure sourceModified changes are considered\nSee reactor/reactor#722.\nIf a change is binary compatible but not source compatible, using\n`onlyBinaryCompatibleModified = true` will mask the issue. This\nchange uses `onlyModified = true` instead. This is slightly more\nverbose, but this is alleviated by (1).\n\n3) Bump to japicmp plugin v0.4.1, exclude NEW_DEFAULT_METHOD as a whole\nThe new `compatibilityChangeExcludes` parameter allows us to ignore all\noccurrences of a default method added to an interface, instead of\nhaving to exclude each such method one by one.\n\nThe fourth commit demonstrates the console report and its filtering,\nand shows that out of the two added interface methods, only the\nnon-default one is reported.",

I've made this choice as a tradeoff between code complexity and proper cache eviction. There might be better solutions, maybe you have suggestions ?\r\n     - I've thought about using `StampedLock` instead of `synchronized`, but I decided to leave it aside and provide a simpler code for first review \r\n - I've added a regression test for the concurrent error, but I would appreciate advise on how I could improve it because:\r\n    - Failure is inconsistent due to the concurrent nature of the problem. I could add a loop to the test, to force failure behavior, but I'm afraid that it would make it too long to execute.\r\n    - Maybe it is too heavy, as it starts its own thread-pool.\r\n - Independently from the current issue, I've seen that there's a duplicated function `format` used both on console logger and JDK logger. I wonder if it is really needed on JdkLogger, because this work should be done internally by the logger. If you agree, I can rework that as a bonus in this PR.\r\n",

In the case of scalar fusion at flatMap operators ( https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/main/reactor-core/src/main/java/reactor/core/publisher/FluxFlatMap.java#L118) the inner chain may be fused with the outer downstream. Since `onLastOperator` must be applied to the inner chain, modification added by the call may break fusion which leads to the `ClastCastException`\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: OlegDokuka <odokuka@vmware.com>",

In some scenarios, that is undesired as it does not allow proper cleanup.\r\n`Scheduler`s should allow shutting down by not accepting new work, but giving the currently executing tasks a chance to finish without interruption. A `Mono<Void> disposeGracefully()` method has been added for that purpose. Upon subscription, it calls `shutdown()` instead of `shutdownNow()` and creates a background task that does `awaitTermination()` to complete the returned `Mono`. It can be combined with `timeout()` and `retry()` operators in realistic scenarios.",

While we don't expect this to be an issue in most\r\nproduction applications, this can lead to hitting native thread limits\r\nfaster. Notably, stress tests around graceful disposal create a lot of\r\nschedulers for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThis change also ensures that the evictor executorServices of both the\r\nBoundedElasticScheduler and ElasticScheduler are limited to at most 1\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nFinally, it attempts to improve the SchedulersStressTest to avoid the\r\nOOMs as much as possible: block on disposeGracefully() calls, increase\r\nthe heap of forked JVMs for jcstress, and ultimately stop covering the\r\nBoundedElasticScheduler in the stress test.\r\n\r\nFixes #3258.",

This change still uses the `FluxPublish` class to implement the logic, however with a few minor changes to its implementation.\r\nFirst of all, `FluxPublish` resets itself after source termination to be able to `connect()` again. `FluxReplay` on the other hand, does not reset itself in the case of only buffering signals without timeout. Therefore, for the behaviour of caching the terminals, `FluxPublish` does not reset itself and replays the terminal when it receives a late subscription.\r\nFor cases with expiry (TTL arguments), `FluxReplay` does indeed reset itself. Therefore, the behaviour for the time constrained values remains as before, using `FluxPublish` implementation for the `0` history case, but without caching terminals, while not honouring the TTL. This case can be later implemented if needed.",

Additionally, a MODIFIED class is\nmarked with ***. This task attempts at pinpointing the incompatible\nchanges only in the report, and printing these lines.\n\nThis report is called out in the \"how to fix\" tip in the CI preliminary\nstep.\n\n2) Ensure sourceModified changes are considered\n\nSee reactor/reactor#722.\n\nIf a change is binary compatible but not source compatible, using\n`onlyBinaryCompatibleModified = true` will mask the issue. This\nchange uses `onlyModified = true` instead. This is slightly more\nverbose, but this is alleviated by (1).\n\n3) Update japicmp-gradle-plugin, exclude NEW_DEFAULT_METHOD as a whole\n\nSince japicmp-grale-plugin v0.4.1 the new `compatibilityChangeExcludes`\nparameter allows us to ignore all occurrences of a default method added\nto an interface, instead of having to exclude each such method one by\none.\n",

Additionally, a MODIFIED class is\nmarked with ***. This task attempts at pinpointing the incompatible\nchanges only in the report, and printing these lines.\n\n2) Ensure sourceModified changes are considered\nSee reactor/reactor#722.\nIf a change is binary compatible but not source compatible, using\n`onlyBinaryCompatibleModified = true` will mask the issue. This\nchange uses `onlyModified = true` instead. This is slightly more\nverbose, but this is alleviated by (1).\n\n3) Bump to japicmp plugin v0.4.1, exclude NEW_DEFAULT_METHOD as a whole\nThe new `compatibilityChangeExcludes` parameter allows us to ignore all\noccurrences of a default method added to an interface, instead of\nhaving to exclude each such method one by one.\n\nThe fourth commit demonstrates the console report and its filtering,\nand shows that out of the two added interface methods, only the\nnon-default one is reported.",

I've made this choice as a tradeoff between code complexity and proper cache eviction. There might be better solutions, maybe you have suggestions ?\r\n     - I've thought about using `StampedLock` instead of `synchronized`, but I decided to leave it aside and provide a simpler code for first review \r\n - I've added a regression test for the concurrent error, but I would appreciate advise on how I could improve it because:\r\n    - Failure is inconsistent due to the concurrent nature of the problem. I could add a loop to the test, to force failure behavior, but I'm afraid that it would make it too long to execute.\r\n    - Maybe it is too heavy, as it starts its own thread-pool.\r\n - Independently from the current issue, I've seen that there's a duplicated function `format` used both on console logger and JDK logger. I wonder if it is really needed on JdkLogger, because this work should be done internally by the logger. If you agree, I can rework that as a bonus in this PR.\r\n",

In some scenarios, that is undesired as it does not allow proper cleanup.\r\n`Scheduler`s should allow shutting down by not accepting new work, but giving the currently executing tasks a chance to finish without interruption. A `Mono<Void> disposeGracefully()` method has been added for that purpose. Upon subscription, it calls `shutdown()` instead of `shutdownNow()` and creates a background task that does `awaitTermination()` to complete the returned `Mono`.
