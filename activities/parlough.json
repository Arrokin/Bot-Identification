It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

There could be further benefits to making more of the messages sent deeply immutable, even if just in terms of following the code and avoiding any of those concerns.",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

These hash algorithms are used very often in non-sensitive contexts, making the query too imprecise in practice.

I'm referring to when someone might miss exporting the env manually; we'll need some pre-build hook that allows us to ship the variable.\n\n### Expected fix\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Yeah, I'm not sure there's an automatic solution specific to Dart or Pub currently,  but I think [this pub issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/3518) covers the situation you mentioned. I recommend adding your use case and support to that issue so it's on the Pub team's radar. This allows them to perhaps better prioritize implementing a solution. \r\n\r\nOnce the Pub team adds or suggests a solution, we will definitely document it on the site! ",

I redirected the link to the old section to this section (@parlough not sure if I did that right) in the mean time, but the example in the lint is basically saying what the new section is recommending about explicit null checks is \"bad\" so we'll have to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThe idea of converting null to a bool is kind of lost, I squeezed it in towards the end but not sure if we want to keep any remnant of that idea or toss it completely. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

I redirected the link to the old section to this section (@parlough not sure if I did that right) in the mean time, but the example in the lint is basically saying what the new section is recommending about explicit null checks is \"bad\" so we'll have to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThe idea of converting null to a bool is kind of lost, I squeezed it in towards the end but not sure if we want to keep any remnant of that idea or toss it completely. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

Do you mean how to specify them so they persist across terminal sessions or do you mean share them for everyone running the commands in the project?\r\n\r\nFor the first case, specifying how to set environment variables is something we've mostly not documented as it is different across operating systems and versions, as well as between different shells occasionally, plus it's not really specific to Dart. Perhaps we could include a page discussing some common methods of doing so and link to it from here as well as any other necessary locations if there's enough of a desire.\r\n\r\nAs for the second case, pub environment variables are meant to be per user rather than tied to a project as each developer each may want to specify their own cache location or need to use their own mirror depending on their location.",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

There could be further benefits to making more of the messages sent deeply immutable, even if just in terms of following the code and avoiding any of those concerns.",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

These hash algorithms are used very often in non-sensitive contexts, making the query too imprecise in practice.

Yeah, I'm not sure there's an automatic solution specific to Dart or Pub currently,  but I think [this pub issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/3518) covers the situation you mentioned. I recommend adding your use case and support to that issue so it's on the Pub team's radar. This allows them to perhaps better prioritize implementing a solution. \r\n\r\nOnce the Pub team adds or suggests a solution, we will definitely document it on the site! ",

I redirected the link to the old section to this section (@parlough not sure if I did that right) in the mean time, but the example in the lint is basically saying what the new section is recommending about explicit null checks is \"bad\" so we'll have to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThe idea of converting null to a bool is kind of lost, I squeezed it in towards the end but not sure if we want to keep any remnant of that idea or toss it completely. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

I redirected the link to the old section to this section (@parlough not sure if I did that right) in the mean time, but the example in the lint is basically saying what the new section is recommending about explicit null checks is \"bad\" so we'll have to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThe idea of converting null to a bool is kind of lost, I squeezed it in towards the end but not sure if we want to keep any remnant of that idea or toss it completely. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

Do you mean how to specify them so they persist across terminal sessions or do you mean share them for everyone running the commands in the project?\r\n\r\nFor the first case, specifying how to set environment variables is something we've mostly not documented as it is different across operating systems and versions, as well as between different shells occasionally, plus it's not really specific to Dart. Perhaps we could include a page discussing some common methods of doing so and link to it from here as well as any other necessary locations if there's enough of a desire.\r\n\r\nAs for the second case, pub environment variables are meant to be per user rather than tied to a project as each developer each may want to specify their own cache location or need to use their own mirror depending on their location.",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

There could be further benefits to making more of the messages sent deeply immutable, even if just in terms of following the code and avoiding any of those concerns.",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

It was a bit messy once migrated to null safety, and the objects can be passed directly instead. To maintain the same system where workers stay alive due to their HTTP connections, messages are now specified within a `WorkerTask` with a `WorkerVerb` enum specifying its type. Messages are shared when immutable and automatically copied when not. I didn't run any benchmarks, but I imagine it may result in some speed ups too due to avoiding some unnecessary object constructions as well as simpler comparisons.\r\n\r\n\\cc @domesticmouse and @khanhnwin As this will be needed for dart-lang/site-www (sooner) and flutter/website (later)",

These hash algorithms are used very often in non-sensitive contexts, making the query too imprecise in practice.

Yeah, I'm not sure there's an automatic solution specific to Dart or Pub currently,  but I think [this pub issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/3518) covers the situation you mentioned. I recommend adding your use case and support to that issue so it's on the Pub team's radar. This allows them to perhaps better prioritize implementing a solution. \r\n\r\nOnce the Pub team adds or suggests a solution, we will definitely document it on the site! ",

I redirected the link to the old section to this section (@parlough not sure if I did that right) in the mean time, but the example in the lint is basically saying what the new section is recommending about explicit null checks is \"bad\" so we'll have to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThe idea of converting null to a bool is kind of lost, I squeezed it in towards the end but not sure if we want to keep any remnant of that idea or toss it completely. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

I redirected the link to the old section to this section (@parlough not sure if I did that right) in the mean time, but the example in the lint is basically saying what the new section is recommending about explicit null checks is \"bad\" so we'll have to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThe idea of converting null to a bool is kind of lost, I squeezed it in towards the end but not sure if we want to keep any remnant of that idea or toss it completely. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

Do you mean how to specify them so they persist across terminal sessions or do you mean share them for everyone running the commands in the project?\r\n\r\nFor the first case, specifying how to set environment variables is something we've mostly not documented as it is different across operating systems and versions, as well as between different shells occasionally, plus it's not really specific to Dart. Perhaps we could include a page discussing some common methods of doing so and link to it from here as well as any other necessary locations if there's enough of a desire.\r\n\r\nAs for the second case, pub environment variables are meant to be per user rather than tied to a project as each developer each may want to specify their own cache location or need to use their own mirror depending on their location.",
