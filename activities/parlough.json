I know that there are issues wanting to get away from embedded dartpads, but in the meantime, I wasn't sure if someone was aware that the dart documentation is broken.\r\n\n\n### Expected fix\n\nIdeally, fix the embedded dartpad examples.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, show the example in a code-block with a link to dartpad (i.e. in a gist).\r\n\r\nI researched [the source ](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/tree/main/src) but I couldn't find where the code sections were being 'rendered'.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I know that there are issues wanting to get away from embedded dartpads, but in the meantime, I wasn't sure if someone was aware that the dart documentation is broken.\r\n\n\n### Expected fix\n\nIdeally, fix the embedded dartpad examples.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, show the example in a code-block with a link to dartpad (i.e. in a gist).\r\n\r\nI researched [the source ](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/tree/main/src) but I couldn't find where the code sections were being 'rendered'.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Beyond that, this adds the associativity labels present on the language spec's \"helpful guide\".\r\n\r\nFixes #4287\r\n\r\n**Staged:** https://dart-dev--pr4332-feature-document-ass-ys8cfbyn.web.app/guides/language/language-tour#operators",

I had some trouble incorporating the full \"source of truth\" portion in to the primary text as many readers may not be familiar with what a \"language grammar\" is and I'm worried it may scare them away from this section. I added a little elaboration to the primary text and added the \"source of truth\" text to the warning which is rather prominent. How does that seem?\r\n\r\nAs for the example and explanation of precedence, we have one right after the table. I added a link to there instead. We don't mention the underlying grammar, but I think that is probably good as many readers of this may not know how to read it, and it could just confuse them. We also don't want too much text/description in the language tour.",

You do not need to alter your code scanning workflows. If you encounter any problems, please <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues\">file an issue</a> or open a private ticket with GitHub Support and request an escalation to engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.26 - 29 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1267\">#1267</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.25 - 21 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We will soon be rolling out a feature of the CodeQL Action that stores some information used to make future runs faster in the GitHub Actions cache. Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step. Previously, CodeQL packs were downloaded during the <code>analyze</code> step. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1218\">#1218</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.4. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1224\">#1224</a></li>\n<li>The newly released <a href=\"https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0\">Poetry 1.2</a> is not yet supported. In the most common case where the CodeQL Action is automatically installing Python dependencies, it will continue to install and use Poetry 1.1 on its own.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon.

You do not need to alter your code scanning workflows. If you encounter any problems, please <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues\">file an issue</a> or open a private ticket with GitHub Support and request an escalation to engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.26 - 29 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1267\">#1267</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.25 - 21 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We will soon be rolling out a feature of the CodeQL Action that stores some information used to make future runs faster in the GitHub Actions cache. Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step. Previously, CodeQL packs were downloaded during the <code>analyze</code> step. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1218\">#1218</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.4. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1224\">#1224</a></li>\n<li>The newly released <a href=\"https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0\">Poetry 1.2</a> is not yet supported. In the most common case where the CodeQL Action is automatically installing Python dependencies, it will continue to install and use Poetry 1.1 on its own. However, in certain cases such as with self-hosted runners, you may need to ensure Poetry 1.1 is installed yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.21 - 25 Aug 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve error messages when the code scanning configuration file includes an invalid <code>queries</code> block or an invalid <code>query-filters</code> block. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1208\">#1208</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

I know that there are issues wanting to get away from embedded dartpads, but in the meantime, I wasn't sure if someone was aware that the dart documentation is broken.\r\n\n\n### Expected fix\n\nIdeally, fix the embedded dartpad examples.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, show the example in a code-block with a link to dartpad (i.e. in a gist).\r\n\r\nI researched [the source ](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/tree/main/src) but I couldn't find where the code sections were being 'rendered'.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I know that there are issues wanting to get away from embedded dartpads, but in the meantime, I wasn't sure if someone was aware that the dart documentation is broken.\r\n\n\n### Expected fix\n\nIdeally, fix the embedded dartpad examples.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, show the example in a code-block with a link to dartpad (i.e. in a gist).\r\n\r\nI researched [the source ](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/tree/main/src) but I couldn't find where the code sections were being 'rendered'.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Beyond that, this adds the associativity labels present on the language spec's \"helpful guide\".\r\n\r\nFixes #4287\r\n\r\n**Staged:** https://dart-dev--pr4332-feature-document-ass-ys8cfbyn.web.app/guides/language/language-tour#operators",

I had some trouble incorporating the full \"source of truth\" portion in to the primary text as many readers may not be familiar with what a \"language grammar\" is and I'm worried it may scare them away from this section. I added a little elaboration to the primary text and added the \"source of truth\" text to the warning which is rather prominent. How does that seem?\r\n\r\nAs for the example and explanation of precedence, we have one right after the table. I added a link to there instead. We don't mention the underlying grammar, but I think that is probably good as many readers of this may not know how to read it, and it could just confuse them. We also don't want too much text/description in the language tour.",

You do not need to alter your code scanning workflows. If you encounter any problems, please <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues\">file an issue</a> or open a private ticket with GitHub Support and request an escalation to engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.26 - 29 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1267\">#1267</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.25 - 21 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We will soon be rolling out a feature of the CodeQL Action that stores some information used to make future runs faster in the GitHub Actions cache. Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step. Previously, CodeQL packs were downloaded during the <code>analyze</code> step. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1218\">#1218</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.4. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1224\">#1224</a></li>\n<li>The newly released <a href=\"https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0\">Poetry 1.2</a> is not yet supported.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step.

I had some trouble incorporating the full \"source of truth\" portion in to the primary text as many readers may not be familiar with what a \"language grammar\" is and I'm worried it may scare them away from this section. I added a little elaboration to the primary text and added the \"source of truth\" text to the warning which is rather prominent. How does that seem?\r\n\r\nAs for the example and explanation of precedence, we have one right after the table. I added a link to there instead. We don't mention the underlying grammar, but I think that is probably good as many readers of this may not know how to read it, and it could just confuse them. We also don't want too much text/description in the language tour.",

Beyond that, this adds the associativity labels present on the language spec's \"helpful guide\".\r\n\r\nFixes #4287\r\n\r\n**Staged:** https://dart-dev--pr4332-feature-document-ass-ys8cfbyn.web.app/guides/language/language-tour#operators",

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step.

Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step.
